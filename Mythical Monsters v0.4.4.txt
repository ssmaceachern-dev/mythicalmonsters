________________


  

A World of Myth
The world before you expands into rolling hills, twilight forests, and sky-biting mountain tops. Fair kings, cruel tyrants, and mysterious beings dwell and dabble in feeble attempts to move fate to their whims. Out there beyond the walls of civilization and past the end of all roads lies mysteries to be discovered and the remnants of ages long since passed.


But the land knows no master and dark powers lurk within the forgotten crevices of the world. Will you and your companions be the one to uncover the secrets of these lands? Or will all of your actions be enough to sway the balance of power?


Welcome to the world of Mythical Monsters: where adventure lies around every corner and new lands, creatures, and more await discovery.
Book Structure
The book is laid out in a number of sections with each containing information on a different aspect of the game. For new players, it’s recommended that you start with the first section Myths & Dice to help you to understand the basic mechanics used in the game. Everything about Mythical Monsters is built upon the foundation of rules established in the first section.


1. Myths & Dice goes over the core mechanics of Mythical Monsters. These concepts are persistent throughout the game.
2. Character Creation covers the process of making a character from start to finish.
3. The Marketplace covers items and details buying and selling in the marketplace.
4. Engagements cover how combat and time sensitive events are handled.
5. Progression details how elements of a character can increase as the game is played.
6. Downtime outlines what characters can do in the time allotted to them between adventures.
7. The Natural World describes how common natural phenomena impact gameplay.
8. The Supernatural describes the supernatural world of Mythical Monsters and what kinds of forces the characters can be expected to encounter in their journeys.
9. Conditions covers the kinds of conditions and status effects characters might acquire as they brave the dangers of their adventure.
Myths & Dice
Mythical Monsters is a collaborative fantasy roleplaying game about taking the roles of characters in a world of myths, magic, and monsters. One player, the Storyteller, acts as the world itself and the arbiter of the rules while the other players act as characters within the adventure created by the Storyteller.
Setting Agnostic
The game of Mythical Monsters is setting agnostic. There is no fixed world or universe in which the game takes place. Instead, Mythical Monsters is intended to be a system of rules built to enhance and inspire adventure in original settings or ones already created. The game assumes that there are fantastical elements, such as magic, as well as dragons, fairies, and other creatures, but does not presume to know the precise details of the world itself. For those who do not have a setting on hand, look to the Making Worlds[a] section for guidance on how to begin creating a setting for play.
The Storyteller
The Storyteller weaves together a world for the players and their created characters to interact with and takes on the role of all opponents, peoples, and antagonistic forces. Despite the moniker of Storyteller, the Storyteller isn’t wholly responsible for the story itself. Rather, it is the players who determine the flow of events by making interesting choices in response to questions and hooks presented by the Storyteller. This back-and-forth conversation acts as the means through which the story itself flourishes.


The true objective of the Storyteller is to set up interesting challenges for the protagonists of the tale to overcome. Sometimes these challenges take the form of antagonists, while others are aspects of the environment itself. Even though the Storyteller presents challenges to the players, they should also be on the same side as the players. 
Dice Rules
In Mythical Monsters, the outcomes of certain actions are determined by rolls of the dice. The numbers 4, 5, and 6 are counted as successes while the numbers 1, 2, 3 are considered blunders.


  
  
  
                      


When a number of dice are rolled, only the successes are counted towards the result. For example, a roll of five[b] dice that produces the result [1,2,4,5,6] would equate to 3 successes as it contains 4, 5, and 6. Blunders in this sense are neutral and don’t contribute towards the success of a roll in any way.
Pushes
6 is a special number in the game of Mythical Monsters. When a player rolls a 6 on a die, they gain a push[c][d]. When a character earns a push, not only does the player count the result as a success, but they can then roll the same die again. The player gains an additional push for each 6 they obtain. If anything other than a 6 is rolled during a push, then the push ends and the results are accounted for normally.
________________


The roll below measures out to 2 successes, but there is one 6 which means that the roller gains one push. They then take the one die and reroll it.
  
  
  
  



Since the roll didn’t result in a 6, the push ends and the roller adds the result to the previous roll causing the total to sum up to 3 successes.
  

________________


Challenges
A challenge is anything that blocks the forward progress of the story or a character from taking an action freely. Narratives are full of challenges that test the abilities of the characters with some only having a trivial impact on the story while others can decide the outcome of life or death. In Mythical Monsters, challenges are created by the Storyteller and presented to the party of characters.


In Mythical Monsters, a challenge’s difficulty is measured by its challenge rating, or CR for short. The challenge rating represents the amount of successes needed in order for the obstacle to be overcome. An obstacle rated at CR 4 requires 4 successes in order for it to be considered overcome.


All challenges generally fit within the following scale of difficulty:


Challenge Rating (CR)
	Level of Difficulty
	CR 0
	There is no obstacle
	CR 1
	An easy obstacle. Anyone can do it.
	CR 2
	An average obstacle. Most can overcome it
	CR 3
	A difficult obstacle. Overcoming it is hard, but not impossible.
	CR 4
	An extremely difficult obstacle. Only the experienced can overcome this.
	CR 5
	A master level obstacle. Only a master can handle this.
	CR 6
	A heroic obstacle. Masters can only hope to overcome it.
	CR 7+
	A mythical obstacle. Stories are told about those who overcome them.
	Challenge Types
While a challenge rating can indicate the amount of successes needed to overcome a given obstacle, the challenge type also indicates how those successes relate to the nature of the challenge.


Blocks
Blocks are obstacles that passively resist forward progress. A block indicates that if the players don’t gain enough successes to overcome the obstacle, then nothing happens.


BLOCK EXAMPLES
	A boulder blocking a door, foliage blocking a road, a fence surrounding a manor…
	

Snares
Snares are obstacles that passively resist movement. A snare indicates that if the players don’t gain enough successes to overcome the obstacle, then they must spend vigor equal to the number of successes required for them to overcome the challenge before they can make any additional Move Actions.


SNARE EXAMPLES
	A briar patch blocking a path through the woods, walking over a pile of collapsed rubble, walking through thick mud…
	

Contests
Contests are obstacles that are made between two active entities. With contests, one side is exerting pressure while another side provides resistance. If the contesting side earns more pressure than the contested side’s resistance, then the margin of pressure exerted is inflicted on the other party. If the contesting side’s pressure is equal or less than the contested side’s resistance, then a stalemate is reached and nothing happens.


CONTEST EXAMPLES
	Physical Pressure vs Physical Resistance in Engagements, Stealth vs. Wits, Buying/Selling in the Marketplace
	

Perils
Perils are obstacles that passively resist forward progress but have a danger attached to them if the players fail to match the challenge’s rating. Perils are often accompanied with some kind of hazard, or a risky situation where failing the challenge places some kind of pressure on a character. When a character makes an Action to overcome a peril, they may be called upon by the Storyteller to make a Resolve Check or gain one rank of the Troubled condition.


PERIL EXAMPLES
	A gaping chasm (Falling), a trap (Wounds/Poison/Disease), swimming into deep waters (Suffocating)…
	

Checks
A check is a challenge where only one success is needed to pass. As long as at least one success is rolled, then a character overcomes the check. However, if the character does not manage to achieve any successes, then the character receives a negative consequence.


CHECK EXAMPLES
	Resolve Checks against a character’s Troubles, Endurance Checks to remain conscious while on Death’s Door
	

Open
Open challenges do not have a hard challenge rating assigned to them. Open challenges are used as gauges to see how successful a character is at an open-ended action with the Storyteller themselves determining how much information they receive as a result of the action.


OPEN CHALLENGE EXAMPLES
	Investigating a room, using Insight to make academic judgements, using Wits to perceive details about the environment
	

Making Tests
A character’s ability in the game of Mythical Monsters is measured through their aspects. There are eight main aspects a character can use to influence challenges: Strength, Finesse, Endurance, Insight, Wits, Resolve, Wealth, and Profession. Each aspect carries a rating which represents the maximum amount of dice a player can roll when making a Test using that aspect. Making a Test can also be referred to as applying an aspect to a challenge.


A Test can be affected by three modifiers: Ease, Enhancement, and Hindrance. Ease represents the amount of successes a character receives towards a Test before dice are rolled. Enhancement represents a number of dice that can be rolled in addition to the aspect rating being applied. Hindrance, in contrast, indicates the amount of successes negated in a Test.


MAKING A TEST
	Ease + Aspect (Rolled) + Enhancement (Rolled)
	AGAINST
	Challenge Rating + Hindrance
	Vigor
Sometimes the results of a Test are not enough to overcome the challenge rating. During these circumstances, a character [e]may be required to spend vigor to increase their chances. Vigor is the characterization of a character’s lifeblood and is determined by taking the sum of a character’s physical and mental aspects: Strength, Finesse, Endurance, Insight, Wits, and Resolve. To spend vigor, a character subtracts an amount from their vigor equal to or less than the rating of the aspect being utilized. For example, if a character with a Strength rating of 2 wanted to spend vigor towards a Test, then they would subtract 2 from their vigor to roll 2 additional dice towards the Test.


A character can spend as much vigor as they would like in a Turn; however, each usage of vigor cannot exceed the associated aspect’s rating. For example, if a character with a Strength rating of 2 were to spend 4 vigor, it would be rolled in increments of 2.


In addition, whenever a character spends vigor, they acquire one point of fatigue. Fatigue is a measurement of your character’s exhaustion and its impact is explained further in the Recovery section.
Minors & Majors
When a player spends vigor, there is a chance of earning a Minor or a Major. Each Minor or Major alters a Test based on the result obtained.


* A Minor Success occurs when all dice rolled result in a success. A Minor Success indicates a favorable condition and provides 1 additional success to the roll. So if a Minor Success was achieved with 4 dice, then the result equals 5 successes total. 
  
  
  
  



* A Major Success occurs when all dice rolled land on a 6. The number of successes from the roll equals double the number of dice used. So if a Major Success is achieved with 4 dice, then the result equals 8 successes total.
  
  
  
  



* A Minor Blunder occurs when all dice rolled result in a blunder. A Minor Blunder indicates the occurrence of an inconvenience. When a Minor Blunder is rolled, the amount of successes achieved towards overcoming a Test is reduced by 1. If no successes can be reduced, then the challenge rating of the obstacle itself is increased by 1.
  
  
  
  



* A Major Blunder occurs when all dice rolled land on a 1. A Major Blunder indicates that a significant misfortune has occurred. When a Major Blunder is rolled, the amount of successes achieved towards overcoming a Test is reduced equal to the number of dice rolled. If no successes can be reduced, then the challenge rating of the obstacle itself is increased by the number of major blunders achieved.
  
  
  
  



When a character spends vigor equal to the aspect they are using towards a Test and earns a Minor or a Major, they also earn a mark in that aspect. Marks are how progression is recorded in Mythical Monsters. Once an aspect has earned six marks, the aspect’s rating increases by 1 and all marks are reset.
Stages of Play
There are two stages of play in the game of Mythical Monsters: Adventure and Downtime. The Storyteller mediates when the game shifts from one stage to the other. During Adventure, time takes center stage as developments unfold, plans are revealed, and the calamity clock ticks down. However, when all conflicts have subsided, the Storyteller can then shift the game into Downtime where characters have ample opportunity to pursue their interests without the pressures of time.
Time & Turns
Time in Mythical Monsters takes the form of Turns. A Turn in the scope of the game is a general block of time in which actions of a certain scale happen.


There are four kinds of Turns in Mythical Monsters: Downtime Turns, World Turns, Local Turns, and Engagement Turns. Each type corresponds to a magnitude of Time indicated by the table below.


Turn
	Turn Duration
	Upscale
	Move Action Distance
	Purpose
	DOWNTIME STAGE
	Downtime
	About 1 Day
	–
	Determined by Storyteller
	Downtime activities, Training
	ADVENTURE STAGE
	World
	About 1 to 4 Hours
	6 World Turns equals 1 Day
	1 Mile
	Traveling, Camping, Performing long Actions
	Local
	About 15 to 60 Minutes
	4 Local Turns equals 1 World Turn
	1 Area
	Exploring a Location, Interacting with a Settlement
	Engagement
	About 15 to 60 Seconds
	–
	1 Square (5 ft2)
	Engaging in Combat, Overcoming Perils, Debating.
	

Turns are used by the Storyteller to shift the focus of the game between magnitudes of scale. For longer endeavors such as traveling across countrysides or performing extended actions like rituals, World Turns are used to mediate the passage of time. However, when more immediate actions take precedent, like exploring a city or trekking through an underground ruin, then Local Turns are used.


The upscale of a turn is used to determine how many turns of that type need to pass before the enveloping turn passes as well. For example, once four Local turns have passed, the enveloping  World turn also passes.
Recovery
At the end of each turn, Recovery occurs. Recovery begins with all characters regaining vigor equal to their Recovery rating which is determined by the sum of their physical aspect ratings. A Recovery rating of 5 for example means that a given character will recover 5 points of vigor at the end of a Turn.


However, any Fatigue[f][g] a character has accrued acts counter to a character’s Recovery. To determine how much vigor is restored, take a character's Recovery rating and subtract their Fatigue rating. If the result is positive, then they regain that amount in vigor. However, if the result is negative, then the player subtracts that amount from their vigor instead. And then if the result is zero then the player's vigor pool remains unchanged.


If a character has accrued any recoverable Conditions during gameplay, they can use Recovery to make one Endurance Test and one Resolve Test to reduce the ranks of a single Physical or Mental condition respectively.
Actions[h][i]
A story does not progress without action and Actions within the game of Mythical Monsters are how the things a character does are characterized. Actions are also used to make Tests against present challenges and obstacles.  


In the game, Actions are represented by one of the following five types: Free Actions, Contested Actions, Move Actions, Assisting Actions, and Concentrated Actions.
Free Actions
A Free Action is an action that has no obstacles associated with it. This could take the form of drawing a sword, opening an unlocked door, or speaking freely. Within a turn, a character can take as many Free Actions as is within reason at no cost to their vigor.
Contested Actions
Contested Actions are actions that are obstructed by some obstacle or are challenged in some way. Contested Actions require the use of a Test and the possible use of vigor in order to overcome them. Generally, a Contested Action is tied to a character’s core aspect such as using Strength to swing a sword or Wits to perceive particular details from a surrounding environment. 


When a Contested Action is made, that becomes the singular Contested Action for the Turn. This means if one character makes a Contested Action to lift a boulder out of the way, then all other characters who make the same action contribute towards the Contested Action. See Assisting Actions for further details.
Move Actions
Move Actions are a type of action that facilitates moving a character a unit of distance based on the current turn being used. World, Local, and Engagement turns all use different units of distance for Move actions.


All characters and entities within the world possess a Movement rating which represents the amount of Move Actions they have available to them each turn. If a character wants to move beyond this allotted amount, then they need to spend vigor to do so. Spending one point of vigor restores enough Move Actions equal to a creature’s Endurance rating but each point of vigor spent increases a character’s fatigue by 1.[j][k]


Ex. A creature with a Movement rating of 4 can move up to 4 units of distance during a World, Local, or Engagement turn. If they wanted to move 5 units of distance, then they would need to spend 1 point of vigor to earn back enough Movement equal to their Endurance rating.
Assisting Actions
If more than one character is capable of making or contributing towards a Test, then the successes obtained from each individual action can be pooled together rather than be handled individually.
Concentrated Actions
A Concentrated action is an action where a character is attempting to stretch a Test across more than one turn. For example, climbing a giant boulder in the middle of an engagement may require more than one Turn to accomplish. Using magic or readying a ranged weapon are also actions that can be further enhanced by Concentrating.


To make an Action into a Concentrated action, a character or entity first makes a Contested Action and then declares that the action will be concentrated. While concentrating, a character can still respond to Contested actions made against them. However, if a character gains a Condition or suffers Wounds before their next Turn, then they will lose all successes gained while concentrating.


If a character manages to make it to their next Turn without taking Wounds or suffering a Condition, they can make the Contested Action again and add the successes achieved to the result of the first roll and so on for each Turn spent Concentrating afterwards. Once the character has stopped concentrating, then their pooled successes are evaluated on that Turn.
Resting
A player character gains the benefit of a Rest during Recovery when they have spent an entire Turn performing no Contested Actions, spending vigor, or taking Wounds. If a character succeeds at meeting these requirements, they can make an Endurance Test to reduce their Fatigue equal to the number of successes earned.


A resting character also can recover Wounds during a Rest. A character can reduce their Wounds rating according to the table below.


Turn
	Wounds Recovered
	Fatigue Recovered
	Engagement
	1
	1
	Local[l]
	Endurance Test
	Endurance Rating
	World
	Recovery Test
	Recovery Rating
	

A player character that has spent one Local Turn resting can reduce their Fatigue and Wounds equal to their Endurance rating. Similarly , a character that spends an entire World Turn resting can reduce their Fatigue and Wounds equal their Endurance rating and gains the added ability to make a Endurance Test to reduce both ratings further.
How to Play
The game of Mythical Monsters plays out in the following pattern.
1. The Storyteller describes the environment and the situation to the players. The story begins on its first turn with the characters of the story being informed of the scene before them.
   1. The characters find themselves in a burning tavern. The situation places the characters in immediate danger so Engagement turns are used. There is fire all around and smoke threatens to steal their breaths away if they don’t react soon. A fire is blocking the main entrance out but there are windows all around.[m]
2. The players take their turn describing what they would like to do. The players then describe how their characters react to the situation at hand using the abilities and equipment attached to their character.
   1. A player declares that their raider from the north wishes to jump through the window and into the street. The Storyteller remarks that the windows are latched shut thus are a Block. 
   2. The player then states they want to apply their Strength to break through the window. The Storyteller thinks that jumping through the windows in this fashion is a Strength Test rated at CR 2. 
   3. The player makes the Strength Test and gets only 1 success. The player states that they want to spend vigor so they subtract from their vigor to roll additional dice and obtain 2 more successes.
3. The Storyteller then describes how the world reacts or changes. After each player has declared how they spend their turn, the Storyteller then describes what happens on the World’s turn. Sometimes events happen in reaction to the players while others may simply proceed naturally.
   1. The player has managed to break through the window and escape the fiery tavern. The Storyteller declares that the fire continues to burn and that people have begun forming a bucket brigade to put out the tavern.
4. The Storyteller and the players state that the Turn is over and players regain Vigor. Once a turn is deemed over by the Storyteller and the players, the characters regain vigor equal to their recovery score minus their fatigue rating. Then a new turn begins.
   1. After narrowly escaping an infernal demise, the player makes several more actions and spends a number of vigor from their pool until both the player and the Storyteller agree that the turn is over. The player then recovers an amount of dice according to their character sheet.

Creating a Character
Stepping into the world of Mythical Monsters begins with creating the origin of a character. Designing a character begins with imagining their origin. Who were they before they entered the story? Were they an old military officer looking to find adventure elsewhere or an orphaned farmer boy who was seized by destiny?
Character Creation
Starting Experience
A character’s starting experience determines the bonus advancements a character gains at the beginning of an adventure or campaign. There are three tiers of starting experience: Novice, Journeyman, and Master. Each tier comes with it a given amount of Advancements and a starting Wealth rating.


Advancements are used to increase the rating of a given aspect, knowledge, profession, or practice by 1. Increasing an aspect’s rating from 1 to 2 costs 1 aspect advancement as would increasing an aspect’s rating from 2 to 3.

Step-by-Step Character Creation
This section serves a guide towards the process of making a character of your very own for the game of Mythical Monsters. Character creation for any new character follows these steps:


1. Determine Starting Experience
2. Determine Ancestry
3. Determine Natures
4. Apply Aspect Advancements
5. Determine Compound Aspects
6. Advance Professions
7. Advance Knowledge
8. Advance Practices
9. Choose Equipment from the Marketplace
10. Determine Allies
11. Determine Physical Details 


Together we will run through the process of creating the character Ingram Wolfsbane to demonstrate each step along the way.
Determine Starting Experience
The first step of the character creation process is determining what a character’s starting experience will be. This detail affects the rest of the character creation process and is determined by the Storyteller at the start of an adventure or campaign.


For the sake of demonstration, Ingram Wolfsbane will be made using the Apprentice tier of starting experience.

Determine Ancestry
The next step of the character creation process is determining the ancestry of the character. For this step, we go to the Ancestry section and choose one that appeals to the character. For the sake of example, Ingram Wolfsbane will be a Dwarf. 


Choose a Natural Boon
After choosing our ancestry, we then select which Natural Boon from our chosen ancestry we would like our character to receive. Dwarfs gain either an aspect advancement towards either their Stamina or Resolve. Lets say Ingram is a particularly willful Dwarf so we’ll choose the Resolve Boon.


Record Ancestry Details
Moving on from the Natural Boon selection, we then record the Ancestry’s Size, Size rating, and Vision to the character sheet.
Determine Natures
Next we must determine our character’s Natures. That is, we must think about who our character is and how they respond to the world. For this, we can turn to the Natures section. Every character, no matter the starting experience, gains two Traits, one Ideal, and one Trouble.


Choose Three Traits
Ingram Wolfsbane is a resolved Dwarf from what we’ve established so far. Now we must assign two Traits to her. Traits are defining characteristics that provide an additional die of Enhancement towards Tests that incorporate them. 


Looking through the list of Traits, Athletic, Daring, and Courageous stand out as fitting characteristics of Ingram.


Choose One Ideal
While a character can have many beliefs and passions, an Ideal is one that stands above all others. It is a philosophy of the character that rings true to their core. 


For Ingram Wolfsbane, let’s say that Courage is her prized Ideal as she seeks to stand above fear and do what’s right when the moment calls.


Choose One Trouble
A Trouble is something that a character struggles with on a daily basis. When a character is confronted with a situation which triggers their Trouble, they will have to make a Resolve Check to avoid succumbing to their Trouble.


Let's give Ingram the Bigmouth Trouble. This means that whenever they are in a situation where they are forced to keep a secret or need to withhold information, their Resolve will be tested or  they risk blurting out the truth.
Advance Aspects
Now that Ingram’s character has been fleshed out, the next step is to upgrade some of their aspects according to their starting experience.


Aspects comprise a character’s Strength, Finesse, Endurance, Insight, Wits, Resolve, and Wealth and all begin at rating 1. Aspects are used throughout the game to overcome Tests set by the Storyteller.


The Novice tier grants 2 Aspect Advancements meaning that we can choose two aspects from the list above to increase by 1 or one aspect to increase by 2.


Ingram at this stage seems to be more geared towards being combat capable so spending the aspect advancements on Strength and Endurance makes sense here. In this case, Ingram’s Strength and Endurance aspect ratings would increase from 1 to 2.
Determine Compound Aspects
Compound aspects play a vital role in how the game of Mythical Monsters is played. A character’s Compound aspects are calculated according to the following formulas:
Maximum Vigor        (Sum of Physical and Mental Aspects)
Recovery                 (Vigor / 2 - Rounded Down)
Death’s Door         (Sum of Physical Aspects)
Movement                 (Size + Endurance)
Carrying Capacity        (Size + Strength)


For Ingram, their Core aspects come out to: Strength 2, Finesse 1, Endurance 2, Insight 1, Wits 1, Resolve 2, and a Size rating of 4 from their Ancestry. By following the directions above, Ingram’s Compound aspects become:
Maximum Vigor        9
Recovery                 4
Death’s Door         5
Movement                 6
Carrying Capacity        6


Now we can take these values and record them on Ingram’s character sheet.
Advance Professions
For this step, we look to find a trade and an associated Profession for Ingram to have some background experience in. By default, all characters start with a rating of 0 in all trades and  professions but are increased according to the number of Profession Advancements we receive from the starting experience tier.


Starting in the Professions section, we can start by choosing a Trade that matches well with our Dwarf. Perhaps having experience in a Military trade might make sense for Ingram. From here, we can choose one of the example Professions to assign to Ingram as an additional detail. 


Now we simply record that down on our character sheet and use the Profession Advancement to give it a rating of 2.
Advance Knowledge
With Professions out of the way, we now look to expand Ingram’s general knowledge. Knowledge within the game provides enhancement towards Insight Tests made to uncover clues or acquire information about a given subject. By default, all characters start with a rating of 0 in each of the seven areas of general Knowledge: Cultures, History, Folklore, Plants, Animals, Lands, and Languages.


The Apprentice tier grants two Knowledge Advancements to spend towards increasing Ingram’s relative familiarity with any of the seven topics mentioned above. Since Ingram is based out of the Military Trade, let's choose to upgrade their knowledge of Cultures.
Advance Practices
Practices are unique elements of a character that grant access to special abilities. A character begins with a number of Practice Advancements received from their starting experience which can be used in one of three ways: Advance a Martial Practice, Advance a Supernatural Practice, or Advance Additional Aspects.
Advance Martial Practices
A Martial Practice allows characters to gain enhancement towards actions as long as the actions meet the requirements specified in the practice. To gain the benefit of a Martial Practice, first choose a Practice from the list supplied under Martial Practices.


Spending a Practice Advancement allows a character’s rating to increase their rating in the Practice by 1. Whenever a character performs an Action that fulfills the requirements of a Practice then they gain Enhancement towards that Action equal to their rating in the Practice.


For example, if we wanted Ingram to be a more capable fighter, we could have her gain Martial Training with Versatile weapons. This means that any time Ingram made an action using a Versatile weapon, they would gain enhancement equal to the practice’s rating which in this case is 1.
Advance Supernatural Practices
Supernatural Practices are special aspects that you construct yourself by first selecting a Supernatural Aspect and pairing it with a Material Form. All characters start with no ability to wield supernatural powers but having a rating in a Supernatural Practice grants access to powers hitherto untold.






Supernatural Aspect
	Create
	Alter
	Sense
	Manipulate
	Destroy
	













Material Forms
	Magic
	Fire
	Water
	Materia
	Wind
	Body
	Mind
	Animal
	Plant
	Image
	





For example, by combining the supernatural aspect Create with the material form Fire, we get the Supernatural Practice of Create Fire which allows a character to create fire and heat.


When choosing a Supernatural Aspect, you must also choose a class of supernatural power from which the character’s power originates. There are three classes of supernatural power: Magical, Clerical, and Mystical.


* Magical characters are able to wield powers due to their magical gifts. While novice magical characters only start with one supernatural practice, they can learn any number of additional magics by seeking out other practitioners.
* Clerical characters gain their powers by forming a divine pact with a being from beyond the material world. Unlike magical characters, clerical characters can only wield as many supernatural powers as their patron will allow. However, clerical characters gain access to the resource Favor which can be substituted for vigor when casting their magic.
   * Clerical characters begin play with Favor equal to their rating x 6
* Mystical characters gain their power from a curio given to them by a great bastion of supernatural magic located somewhere in the material world. The curio grants a character access to a supernatural power as long as the curio remains in their possession and does not break. Mystical characters also gain access to their own resource called Essence which is taken from the world and used to enhance their magic.
   * Mystical characters begin play with Essence equal to their rating x 3.


If Ingram were to be gifted with supernatural ability, we could opt to spend one of the Practice Advancements to give them a Supernatural Practice with a  rating 1.
Advance Additional Aspects
If neither Martial nor Supernatural Aspects interest you, then you can opt to turn the Practice Advancements into an Aspect, Profession, or Knowledge advancement instead. Optionally, you can also spend the Practice Advancements to increase the Quality rating of an item purchased from the Marketplace.


Ingram seems to be shaping up to be a formidable fighting Dwarf so let's give her a rating in the Martial Practice of Parrying. This means that during combat, Ingram has a better chance to resist incoming damage when they use Finesse to do so.
Choose Equipment from the Marketplace
Now it is time to determine the character’s starting Equipment. A new character must choose their starting Weapons, Armor Set, Apparel, Starting Pack, and Trinket from the Marketplace.


Each piece of equipment has a quality rating which acts as a measure of its durability. In order to give a character a starting piece of equipment, the quality rating of the item must be at least 1 as items with a quality rating of 0 are considered broken and unusable. To calculate what the quality rating of a character’s starting item would be, take their Wealth aspect and subtract the value listed in the quality rating box in each item table provided. 


QUALITY RATING
	WEALTH RATING - RARITY
	 
This value indicates the rarity of the item which is explained further in the Marketplace section.
________________


A character with a Wealth rating of 3 that wants a starting item with Rarity 2 can only acquire it at a Quality rating of 1.
________________




Choose Armaments
When choosing a character’s starting weapon, a player has the following options:
* Two light melee weapons
* One light melee weapon and one versatile weapon
* One light weapon and one shield
* One versatile weapon and one shield
* One heavy weapon
* One ranged weapon and one light weapon


Light weapons are weapons that can only be wielded in one hand whereas Heavy weapons require both hands. Versatile weapons fall in the middle where less strength is required to wield them in both hands but where more strength is required to wield it in one.


The Strength Requirement of a weapon indicates the minimum Strength aspect rating required in order to use a weapon’s size rating as Enhancement towards either Weapon actions or resisting them. A character with less strength than the required amount can still wield it but does not receive this benefit.

	Steel can also be chosen as a material for a weapon but increases any starting weapon’s rarity by 3. Doing so grants a +1 Enhancement bonus towards Weapon actions made with the weapon.
	Shields are a hybrid between weapons and armor as they can be used for both offense and defense. To construct a shield, first choose a shield material and then determine its size rating. A shield’s size rating can serve as Enhancement whenever a character makes a Contested action to create physical resistance or as Enhancement to a Contest. Shields can also function as a melee weapon and get access to all of the Weapon Actions that entail so long as the shield fits the criteria for each Weapon Action.

Ranged weapons are used to send a piece of ammunition at a target from a distance. The use of any ranged weapon requires the use of both hands. Ammunition is found in a character’s starting pack.

Ingram has a Wealth rating of 3 as part of starting off in the Novice Tier. Let’s give her a standard Longsword. We start by choosing the Material, in this case Iron, and then the Class (Melee) and the Subclass (Versatile). The total Rarity so far is 1 which means the Quality rating of the weapon becomes 2.


Choose an Armor Set
After choosing a weapon, next choose an armor set for the character to begin playing in. The key elements of an armor set are its natural resistances, physical vulnerabilities, and its armor rating. Natural resistances represent the amount of natural pressure they can resist before the character takes wounds. Physical vulnerabilities tie in with the armor rating: If a character is made the target of a Weapon action and the attack type matches one of the vulnerabilities of an armor set, then the character can use the Armor rating as Enhancement when they resist. However, if the attack type does not match any vulnerabilities an armor set possesses, then the character can use the Armor rating as Ease towards resisting instead.

Choose an Apparel Set
An Apparel Set is simply a description of what the character is wearing. What kind of shirt do they like to wear? Do they have a signature style? Or do they wear the clothes of their trade?


For Ingram, we can simply list down that they wear Soldier apparel. The Quality rating of the Apparel then becomes equal to their Wealth Aspect which is 3.


Choose a Pack
To choose a Starting Pack, peruse the available bundles under the Starting Packs and choose one that fits to the character. For Ingram, we will simply go with the Journeyman’s Pack, a very reasonable assortment of items that will aid the character’s future adventures. For the Quality rating of each item, we take Ingram’s Wealth Aspect of 3 and apply any modifiers to get the total quality of the item.

Starting Packs
For each of these packs, the quality of the Pack and the items within equals your character’s Wealth rating up to a maximum of 6. For smaller characters, all of the sizes listed decrease according to their size step. For larger characters, all of the sizes listed increase according to their size step.


We then record all of the pack’s details and contained items onto our character sheet before moving onwards. You can add more items to the Pack if you so wish, but keep in mind that adding too many may cause Encumbrance.


Encumbrance
A character can wear as many packs as is within reasonable boundaries of the imagination. If the Total Size of the items a character is carrying exceeds their Carrying Capacity, then the character’s Movement is hindered by the margin. For example, if Ingram’s Pack had a Total Size that exceeded their Carrying Capacity by 1, then their Movement would become 3 rather than 4 while they are Encumbered.


In addition, any Encumbrance a character has also acts as Hindrance to all Tests based on Physical Aspects.

Choose a Trinket
Now it’s time to choose a Trinket. Trinkets are small items of an inconsequential size (Size 0) that add a touch of flavor to the character. Perhaps they acquired the Trinket from a mysterious origin or maybe it was handed down to them by a family member. For this step, you can either pick a Trinket that appeals to you from the list, use a random number generator to pick a number between 1 to 100, or approach the Storyteller with an idea for a Trinket of your very own.


For Ingram, we’ll say they received Trinket #24 as their intriguing item, a medal known to be awarded to heroes of a long forgotten kingdom. Maybe it was handed down to them by a beloved grandparent or they happened upon it while they were serving in the Military. The story is yours to decide.

Determine Allies (Optional)
Now it’s time to determine Ingram’s Allies. Allies take the form of People, Factions, and Communities that a character can rely upon to provide some assistance or measure of information. This step is entirely optional but serves as a good way to flesh out the character even further.


When making an Ally, choose from one of fourteen Trades to associate with them:
Agriculture    Art    Crafts    Criminal    Entertainment    Government    Medicine   Merchant Military    Religion    Sailor    Scholarship    Service    Vagabond


For Ingram Wolfsbane the Dwarf, lets have their family serve as an Ally for them to call upon in times of need. We’ll pair them with the Military Trade to suggest Ingram stems from a line of proud warriors.
Determine Physical Details
By this step, the character is pretty much complete but now you can add some physical details. What does someone see when they see your character? Do they see a proud Dwarf with dirty blonde hair tied in the back? Or do they see the number of scars they’ve accumulated from their experience on the battlefield? Anything within reason is perfectly acceptable and you should feel unstrained in how you feel your character should be pictured.


Now your character is ready for a world of adventure. Many things will change about them on their journey, but now we know how it started.

Ancestry
Determine Ancestry
A character’s Ancestry determines their base limits and natural characteristics. Each species within the world of Mythical Monsters possesses unique abilities that have allowed them to excel in their respective homelands. Your character’s ancestry forms the basis of their physical identity. A child of human parents will resemble a human just as a spawn of dragons will resemble a dragon. 
Natural Boons
In making a character, you must choose between an Ancestry’s Physical Boon or Mental Boon. A Boon increases a character’s Aspect by 1 in addition to any upgrades they’ve received from their starting experience.
Size
In the world of Mythical Monsters, a creature’s size and Size rating determine how big it is and how much base movement it possesses. After all, larger characters often have bigger strides that allow them to outpace smaller creatures. 


A creature’s tactical size determines the maximum number of squares it takes up on a gridded map. A fractional tactical size represents the number of creatures it would take of that size to fill a single square. It would take four Tiny-sized creatures to fill up a single space in a grid. 


Note that a tactical size does not mean a creature will fill up the entire space. For example, a Giant-sized snake may only be at least 8 feet long but it will certainly not be 8 feet wide.

	Vision
To see or not to see, that is the question. Vision in Mythical Monsters is what allows a character to use their Wits aspect to view and inspect their surroundings. However, the amount of lighting can significantly affect creatures with one kind of vision versus another as shown in the table below.


Lighting
	Common Vision Hindrance
	Night Vision Hindance

	Daylight

	Dim Light
	1
	1
	A moonlit night, shade
	Dark
	6
	0
	A moonless night, an unlit dungeon
	

As shown, if a character with Common vision attempts to perform an action that requires vision while in darkness, then the action will be hindered by 6. Only by lighting up a torch or making a Wits Test to overcome the darkness itself. And vice versa, if a character with Night vision attempts to make an action in broad daylight, then their actions would be hindered by 6.
Natural Features
A creature’s natural features are physical characteristics inherited from being a member of their given ancestry. Any natural features accompanied with Slash, Pierce, or Bludgeon indicate the natural weapons a creature has access to and can use towards unarmed Weapon actions. If a feature is accompanied with the Variant keyword, that means a player can choose to replace an aspect of their character with the variant feature instead.

Natures
Determine Natures


Physical and mental aspects define a character's abilities but their natures are used to describe their personality. In Mythical Monsters, there are three kinds of natures: Traits, Ideals, and Troubles. Each work to help establish who a character is rather than what.
Traits
Traits take the form of a word or phrase used to describe a character's outstanding characteristics or personality traits. Traits can be invoked to grant an additional die of Enhancement towards a challenge or situation that incorporates it. For example, a character with the 'Strong' trait would be able to invoke it whenever they made actions towards challenges requiring Strength to overcome. Only one trait can be invoked towards a Test.


When adding a Trait to a character sheet, you can take the Trait one step further by writing how the character obtained the trait. Doing so both provides context for how the character obtained this trait and also provides some inspiration for how they might use it.

“I learned to be Courageous by braving into the dark woods long ago to look for my sister when we were young”
“I became Alert when I caught my brother trying to steal something rightfully mine”
“I learned how to be Moralistic after training to be a paladin at the palace”

Ideals
Ideals are themes, concepts, or philosophies a character follows with conviction; they are a part of the character's core and it would take some difficulty to go against them. It also acts as guidance for when a character needs to determine how a character might interpret a given situation and also how they may respond to it.


Ideals can be invoked when a supernatural force is attempting to control a character and make them perform an action against their ideals. In these circumstances, the character gains one die of Enhancement towards resisting the effect.


When adding an Ideal to a character sheet, you can take the Ideal one step further by writing how the character obtained the Ideal or how they interpret it. Doing so both provides context for the Ideal and also provides some inspiration for how they might interpret it.

Troubles
Troubles are aspects of a character that causes them to struggle when placed in a situation where they must confront them. Like with Traits, Troubles take the form of a word or phrase. When a character is exposed towards one of their Troubles, they must make a Resolve Check. On a success, they manage to steel their resolve. However, on a failed Resolve Check, the character gains one rank of the Troubled condition which hinders all aspects for as long as the character's flaw is tested. The character must repeat this process for each turn that the Trouble remains present.


________________


A character with the Trouble “Afraid of Dogs” will need to make a Resolve Check whenever they are in the presence of dogs or perceive something related to dogs. If the Resolve Check succeeds, then they manage to steel their nerves.


However, if the character fails the Resolve Check, then the character gains one rank of the Troubled Condition.
________________




When adding a Trouble to a character sheet, you can take the Trouble one step further by writing how the character obtained the Trouble in the first place. Doing so both provides context for the Trouble and also provides some inspiration for how they might respond to it.


EXAMPLES
________________


“I struggle with Spiders. I was bitten by a spider as a child and I never fully recovered”
“I am a Troublemaker. If I can bypass law and authority, then I will”
“I am Humorless. I struggle with jokes and often take them literally”

Invoking Natures
Not only do Natures help define a character, but they can be invoked for benefits during play. A Nature can be invoked when it makes narrative sense in the context of the story.


Invoking a Trait or Ideal allows a player to add one additional die of Enhancement to a Test.
________________


A character with the Strong trait that is blocked by a boulder that requires Strength to move can choose to invoke their Trait and add one additional die towards a Strength Test to move it.
________________




A Trouble is invoked whenever a character is confronted by their respective Trouble. When this happens, a character must make a Resolve Check. If the Resolve Check is successful, then the character manages to withstand their Trouble for the Turn. However, if the Resolve Check fails then the character succumbs to their Trouble and gains one rank of the troubled condition. The troubled character must then repeat the Resolve Check every turn they remain exposed to the source of their trouble.


Any Action the character takes while a character is Troubled is hindered according to the type of blunder as long as the source of their Trouble is present.


There may be some situations where a Trouble can act as a Trait and allow the addition of a trait die but this requires consensus between the player and the Storyteller.
Professions
Advance Professions


Professions represent your character’s background before delving into the world of Mythical Monsters and represents their area of expertise in a given Trade. Each Profession is rated on a scale from 0 to 6 and is associated with a relevant Trade.


There are fourteen trades that a character can find a Profession in upon making their character:
Agriculture    Art    Crafts    Criminal    Entertainment    Government    Medicine   Merchant Military    Religion    Sailor    Scholarship    Service    Vagabond


A given rating in a Profession represents an amount of Enhancement that can be added to Insight Tests  that relate to a given skill set. It also allows characters to make items or perform services associated with that Profession by making a Profession Test.
________________


Consider a character who has a rating in the Thief profession and comes across a locked door. They could use their rating as a Thief as Ease towards an Insight Test to identify aspects of the lock and then .

Aspects
Advance Aspects


An aspect is a representation of a creature’s physical and mental capabilities. Each Aspect forms the base of a Test which skills, abilities, and enhancements build upon in order to overcome Obstacles. Within the game of Mythical Monsters, there are six core aspects in total divided into physical and mentals:


Physical Aspects
________________


Strength - A measure of a character’s physical power and brawn. Strength is used for making slashing or bludgeoning attacks, performing feats of strength, and contributes towards the maximum amount that a creature can carry. It also represents the maximum Size rating that a creature can carry without hindrance.


Finesse - A measure of a character’s precision, nimbleness, and coordination. Finesse is used for making piercing attacks, making throws, using ranged weaponry, sneaking, sleight of hand, and coordinated maneuvers.


Endurance - A measure of a character’s physical fortitude and resilience. Endurance is used for determining movement, resisting physical status conditions, and feats of endurance.


Mental Aspects
________________


Insight - A measure of a character’s academic knowledge and memory. Insight is used for making educated observations and learning new skills.


Wits - A measure of a character’s senses and observational skill. Wits is used for perception, social observations, and determining how fast a character acts in Engagements.


Resolve - A measure of a character’s willpower, charisma, and mental fortitude. Resolve is used in social engagements, making deceptions, overcoming Troubles, and resisting Mental ailments.


Wealth - A measure of a character’s monetary power and material resources. Wealth is used to buy and sell items in the marketplace but can also be extended towards influencing social engagements.  
Compound Aspects
Compound Aspects are important facets of a character that derive from their Core Aspects. Each Compound Aspect lists how they are calculated:


Maximum Vigor        (Sum of Physical and Mental Aspects)
Recovery                 (Sum of Physical Aspects)
Death’s Door         (Sum of Physical Aspects)
Movement                 (Size + Endurance)
Carrying Capacity        (Size + Strength)


Vigor, as mentioned previously, is the dice pool from which dice can be drawn in order to try and gain more successes towards a Test. The Maximum Vigor value determines the most vigor a character can have at any given time.


Recovery is the amount of Vigor that is restored during Recovery. At the end of a Turn, a character recovers an amount of Vigor equal to their Recovery rating minus their Fatigue rating. The amount of recovered Vigor cannot exceed a character’s Maximum Vigor aspect.


Death’s Door is a value that represents the maximum amount of Wounds a character can have before the character is bloodied and put in mortal danger. If the amount of wounds a character has sustained rises above this value, then the difference is subtracted from the character’s vigor instead. See the Bloodied condition under Conditions for additional details.


Movement represents the amount of Move Actions a character can move on a given turn before they must spend vigor to obtain more Move Actions.


Carrying Capacity represents the Total Size of items that a given character can carry before their Movement is hindered by any further margin.


Practices
Advance Practices


Practices are unique skills or abilities that grant particular boons towards characters possessing a rating in them. Each Practice comes with a specific requirement that must be satisfied before a player can add the Practice’s rating as Enhancement to a Test. In order to be able to use a Practice, a character must have a rating of at least 1.
________________


A roguish character with a rating of 2 in the Fighting Practice (Pierce) can roll 2 dice towards Enhancement without spending vigor any time they perform a Pierce attack action.
________________




A character can use multiple Practices towards a given Test as long as the requirements for each Practice are satisfied.
________________


If the roguish character with a rating of 2 in the Fighting Practice (Pierce) also had a rating of 2 in Environment Practice (Forest), then they could roll 4 dice towards Enhancement any time they made a Pierce action in a Forest.

To fight against the dangers of the world and the power of the wilderness, proper training (and luck) separates the living from the dead. Each form of Training listed below grants Enhancement equal to the rating a character possesses in that field. A character with a rating of 2 in Martial Training (Slash) would be able to add 2 Enhancement Dice whenever they performed a Slash Weapon action against an opponent. 


If a character possesses more than one Martial Practice, then they can add the ratings of each Martial Practice as Enhancement to their Actions as long as the requirements of those Martial Practices are met. If a character was using a Light Weapon, was fighting in a Jungle, and had ratings in Weapon Training (Light) and Land Training (Jungle), then they would be able to add both ratings to their next Weapon Action.

Supernatural Practices
Advance Supernatural Practices
Within the world of Mythical Monsters, there are those who are capable of performing wondrous feats through the use of supernatural practices. Supernatural practices allow characters to influence an aspect of the natural world, or a material form as they’re referred to in this book. How a material form is influenced depends on the nature of the supernatural aspect being applied to it. Supernatural aspects are represented by a verb affecting a material form which takes the form of a noun. The joint phrase created from combining them together forms a supernatural practice.


SUPERNATURAL ASPECT

For more information on Supernatural Practices, go to the Supernatural section of this book.
Magical
A magical character derives their supernatural power from their practice and knowledge in the Magical Arts. This practice derives from either the tutelage of a master or from one’s own self discovery.


To choose a Magical practice, begin by pairing one Supernatural Aspect with one Form of Magic. For a wizard keen on destructive fiery power, they might create a practice in the form of Create Fire.

A rating in a given Magical Practice represents the maximum any given focus aspect can be when a character is using the Focus action to manifest their supernatural abilities. See the Focus action for additional details.
________________


A magical character with a rating of 2 in Create Fire can make a Focus Test at a rating of 2,  target an area anywhere within 60ft, target anything in a 2sq x 2sq area within that range, and make the effect last for up to two turns of an Engagement.
________________


Versatile
A character that has aptitude in one Magically-based Supernatural Practice is candidly capable of picking up another. In order for Magicians to learn other Supernatural Practices in their field, they must seek out other Magicians, books, or discover pieces of lore and wisdom to give guidance in such tasks.
Magical Practice Actions
Having a rating in a Magical practice grants access to special Actions that can be used in tandem with the Focus action.


Concentrating
When building Focus, the amount of Focus Points may not be enough for what the character is intending to do. If the player would like to try and build more Focus on top of what they’ve earned already, they can choose to turn the Focus Action into a Concentrated Action.


A creature using the Concentrate Action must not take Wounds or suffer Conditions while using this Action. If the creature manages to maintain Focus for an entire Round, then on their next Turn they can use vigor regained during Recovery to generate more Focus Points towards the maintained effect. 


However, if the creature takes Wounds or suffers a Condition, then all generated Focus Points are lost.


Holding
A character can also choose to hold onto Focus Points they’ve accumulated until their next Turn by taking the Hold Action. The Hold Action is a free action that allows a character to keep their supernatural power preserved until the right opportunity presents itself. 


Taking this Action requires spending one point of vigor to maintain Focus. During this time, the character may make Actions they would normally be capable of performing. However, if the creature takes Wounds or gains a Condition, then all generated Focus Points are lost.


Activate Glyph (Free Action)
Magical Practices can also be transcribed into glyphs of power. These glyphs allow the caster to generate Focus Points and transcribe them into a glyph at a fixed position. 


To create a glyph, the caster simply designs the supernatural effect as if they were using the Focus Action normally while using the Range to account for how far away they can be from the glyph to activate it. The focus area defines the size of the glyph as well as how long it will take a magical character to craft it. A glyph of power takes a number of Local turns to make equal to the focus area of the effect.


For example, If a supernatural effect is affecting a 4sq wide zone, then the character making the glyph will require 4 Local turns or 1 World turn in order to complete it.


Activating a glyph is a mental trigger and can be done once per turn whenever the creator wills it so long as they are within the focus range of the effect. Upon activation, the glyph releases its stored effect upon anything within its focus area and is used up. However, a magical character may reuse the glyph the following turn by spending an equal amount of vigor towards the Focus action to reactivate it. Glyphs can only be activated by the character that created them.

Clerical
A clerical character is one who acts as a conduit of supernatural power to a patron entity that dwells beyond the confines of the material world. This relation takes the form of a spiritual bond where the character accumulates Favor from their patron to perform miraculous feats.


To create a Patron, begin by selecting one portfolio of power from the list below. If none of the portfolios below appeal to you, you may create your own with the Storyteller’s approval.


Air, Animal, Army, Artifice, Astral, Autumn, Avarice, Balance, Bestial, Cat, Cavern, Celerity, Chaos, Charity, Charm, City, Cold, Commerce, Community, Competition, Corruption, Courage, Craft, Creation, Darkness, Death, Decay, Destiny, Destruction, Diabolic, Domination, Dream, Emotion, Endurance, Envy, Evil, Exorcism, Family, Fate, Feast, Fire, Force, Forge, Fury, Generosity, Ghosts, Glory, Gluttony, Good, Greed, Harvest, Hatred, Healing, Hope, Humility, Hunger, Hunt, Illusion, Inquisition, Insight, Joy, Knowledge, Law, Liberation, Life, Luck, Lust, Madness, Magic, Metal, Mind, Moon, Night, Nobility, Ocean, Ooze, Oracle, Pact, Pain, Passion, Patience, Pestilence, Planning, Plant, Pleasure, Pride, Protection, Purity, Radiance, Renewal, Repose, Retribution, Rune, Sand, Seduction, Shadow, Sky, Slime, Sloth, Spider, Spirit, Spite, Spring, Storm, Strength, Suffering, Summer, Sun, Temperance, Temptation, Thirst, Time, Trade, Travel, Treachery, Trickery, Truth, Tyranny, Undead, Undeath, War, Water, Wealth, Weather, Winter, Wrath, Zeal


The portfolio of power you choose represents a theme or guiding philosophy of your Patron that your character must follow and venerate. Once a portfolio has been selected, choose a supernatural aspect and a material form from the table below to form the character’s supernatural practice. This combination represents the supernatural power your character manifests when channeling their Patron.

A rating in a given Clerical Practice represents the maximum any given focus aspect can be when a character is using the Focus action to manifest their supernatural abilities. See the Focus action for additional details.
________________


A clerical character with a rating of 2 in Create Fire can make a Focus Test at a rating of 2,  target an area anywhere within 60ft, target anything in a 2sq x 2sq area within that range, and make the effect last for up to two turns of an Engagement.
________________


Favor
Favor is a resource that clerical characters can tap into to generate focus points instead of vigor. One point of Favor equals one focus point and a clerical character can have any amount of Favor stored away for later use. However, a character can only draw upon as much Favor equal to their rating in the supernatural practice.


Characters begin play with Favor equal to their Supernatural Practice rating multiplied by 6.
________________


A character with a rating of 2 in Create Fire can spend up to 2 points of Favor to generate 2 focus points towards the Focus action in addition to any vigor they’re spending.
________________




Favor is obtained by performing rituals, offering tributes, honoring oaths, and performing deeds for one’s Patron.


Rituals
A ritual is an action a clerical character can take to accrue Favor. In order to enact a ritual, a character must spend a turn performing the ritual. Different turns produce different amounts of Favor depending on the time spent.




Turn
	Favor Gained
	Engagement
	1
	Local
	Resolve Rating
	World
	Resolve Rating + Resolve Test
	



A given ritual can only be performed once per day. For example, if a ritual was made during an Engagement turn, the character would not be able to perform another ritual until the next day. During a ritual, characters do not gain the benefits from resting or any associated actions.


Tributes
Tributes are items or creatures that can be sacrificed in order to provide Enhancement towards a ritual. To sacrifice something as tribute, the item must be placed within a seal of power large enough to contain it. See the Activate Seal action under Clerical Practice actions for more details.


For item tributes, the quality rating of the item acts as Enhancement. If the item possesses an Enchantment, then the quality rating of the Enchantment is included.


For living tributes, the Enhancement is equal to the Endurance rating of the creature plus the size rating of the creature. In order for a living creature to be made into a sacrifice, it must be on Death's Door.


Oaths
An Oath is a promise or spiritual pact made towards one's Patron to uphold an Ideal. Clerical characters who choose to take on an Oath can pick an additional Ideal for their character. If a situation challenges a character's Ideal but the character manages to uphold it, then the character receives Favor equal to their supernatural practice's rating.


However, if the character fails to uphold the chosen Ideal, then they lose all Favor with their Patron.


Quests
Favor may also be used as a reward by one's Patrons for performing certain tasks. The clerical character will receive a dream or some kind of supernatural message informing them of the task and the amount of Favor they can expect to receive upon completion.
Multiple Patrons
A clerically empowered character is not solely limited to serving just one Patron. For example, in polytheistic temples, the worship of multiple deities is commonplace. However, Favor is managed individually amongst each and not altogether. This means Favor accrued towards one Patron cannot be used towards another’s Focus action.
Clerical Practice Actions
Having a rating in a clerical practice grants access to special actions that can be used in tandem with the Focus action.


Concentrating
When building Focus, the amount of Focus Points may not be enough for what the player character is intending to do. If the player would like to try and build more Focus on top of what they’ve earned already, they can choose to turn the Focus Action into a Concentrated Action.


A creature using the Concentrate action must not take Wounds or suffer Conditions while using this Action. If the creature manages to maintain Focus for an entire Round, then on their next Turn they can use vigor regained during Recovery to generate more Focus Points towards the maintained effect. 


However, if the creature takes Wounds or suffers a Condition, then all generated Focus Points are lost.


Holding
A character can also choose to hold onto Focus Points they’ve accumulated until their next Turn by taking the Hold Action. The Hold Action is a free action that allows a character to keep their supernatural power preserved until the right opportunity presents itself. 


Taking this Action requires spending one point of vigor to maintain Focus. During this time, the character may make Actions they would normally be capable of performing. However, if the creature takes Wounds or gains a Condition, then all generated Focus Points are lost.


Activate Seal (Free Action)
Clerical practices can also be transcribed into seals of power. These seals allow the caster to generate Focus Points and transcribe them into a seal at a fixed position. 


To create a seal, the caster simply designs the supernatural effect as if they were using the Focus Action normally while using the Range to account for how far away the character can be from the seal to activate it. The focus area defines the size of the seal as well as how long it will take a clerical character to craft it. A seal of power takes a number of Local turns to make equal to the focus area of the effect.


For example, If a supernatural effect is affecting a 4sq wide zone, then the character making the seal will require 4 Local turns or 1 World turn in order to complete it.


Activating a seal is a mental trigger and can be done once per turn whenever the creator wills it so long as they are within the focus range of the effect. Upon activation, the seal releases its stored effect upon anything within its focus area and is used up. However, a clerical character may reuse the seal the following turn by spending an equal amount of vigor towards the Focus action to reactivate it. Seals can only be activated by characters and creatures following the same Patron.

Mystical
Mystical Practices draw their abilities from bastions of Supernatural power found in the world. A character gains their Mystical Powers by attuning to one of these sources and forging the bond into a curio, an item that they use to channel their powers.


To create a Mystical Practice, select a Supernatural Aspect and a Material Form to pair together. This represents the ability that your character inherits from the source of their mystical powers.








Supernatural Aspect
	Create
	Alter
	Sense
	Manipulate
	Destroy
	













Material Forms
	Magic
	Fire
	Water
	Materia
	Wind
	Body
	Mind
	Animal
	Plant
	Image
	



A rating in a given Mystical Practice represents the maximum any given focus aspect can be when a character is using the Focus action to manifest their supernatural abilities. See the Focus action for additional details.
________________


A mystical character with a rating of 2 in Create Fire can make a Focus Test at a rating of 2,  target an area anywhere within 60ft, target anything in a 2sq x 2sq area within that range, and make the effect last for up to two turns of an Engagement.
________________




This ultimately coalesces in a curio that represents the bond between a character and their chosen source of power.


The curio is an item that is carried around on the character's person. To anyone other than the character, it functions as a normal item. Only the bonded character can use the supernatural power tied with it. The character must be in contact with the curio in order to use their power; If they lose the curio or if the curio's Quality as an item is reduced to zero, then they must find the origin of their supernatural powers and obtain a new one.
Essence
Essence is a resource mystical characters can tap into to generate focus points rather than spend vigor when using the Focus action to manifest a supernatural effect. One point of Essence equals one Focus Point with regards towards the Focus action.


Characters begin play with Essence equal to their Supernatural Practice rating multiplied by 3. The maximum amount of Essence a curio can store is equal to their rating in the supernatural practice multiplied by 3.
________________


A mystical character with a rating of 2 in the Create Fire begins play with 6 Essence and their curio can only store up to 6 Essence.
________________




A mystical character can only utilize the Essence of a material form aligned with their curio. For example, characters with a rating in the supernatural practice of Create Fire can only draw out Essence from fires and sources of heat.


Essence is gathered by using a Contested action to use the Collect Essence ability.
________________


For example, a character with a rating of 2 in a Create Fire can store up to 12 points of Essence within their curio.
________________


Mystical Practice Actions
Collect Essence (Action)
To collect Essence, a Mystical character must use the Focus action. Using the Focus action, the following requirements must be met:
* Focus points applied towards power are spent as if the supernatural aspect Destroy were being applied to the material form.
* The Focus Area must encapsulate the targeted material form being absorbed.


Each success obtained from power used in the Focus action equals one point of Essence the mystical character can store into their curio. If the amount of Essence gathered overflows the amount of Essence a Curio can store, then the excess Essence is instead sent to the origin of the character’s curio.
________________


A character whose curio grants them the power of Create Fire can use the Collect Essence action to destroy an existing campfire and turn any Fire Pressure the fire was giving off into Essence for later use. 
________________




Alternatively a character can spend vigor to contribute their own essence towards the curio. However, the character cannot spend more than their rating in their Mystical practice at a time.
________________


A mystical character with Create Fire 2 can use the Collect Essence action to spend up to 2 vigor in order to restore essence. Any successes they obtain restores an equal amount of essence and they can repeat this as many times as they wish. Just note each expenditure of vigor increases their fatigue by 1 as with any other aspect.
________________




Concentrating
When building Focus, the amount of Focus Points may not be enough for what the player character is intending to do. If the player would like to try and build more Focus on top of what they’ve earned already, they can choose to turn the Focus Action into a Concentrated Action.


A creature using the Concentrate Action must not take Wounds or suffer Conditions while using this Action. If the creature manages to maintain Focus for an entire Round, then on their next Turn they can use vigor regained during Recovery to generate more Focus Points towards the maintained effect. 


However, if the creature takes Wounds or suffers a Condition, then all generated Focus Points are lost.


Holding
A character can also choose to hold onto Focus Points they’ve accumulated until their next Turn by taking the Hold Action. The Hold Action is a free action that allows a character to keep their supernatural power preserved until the right opportunity presents itself. 


Taking this Action requires spending one point of vigor to maintain Focus. During this time, the character may make Actions they would normally be capable of performing. However, if the creature takes Wounds or gains a Condition, then all generated Focus Points are lost.


Activate Brand (Free Action)
Mystical practices can also be transcribed into brands of power. These brands allow the caster to generate Focus Points and transcribe them into a brand at a fixed position. 


To create a brand, the caster simply designs the supernatural effect as if they were using the Focus Action normally while using the Range to account for how far away the character can be from the brand to activate it. The focus area defines the size of the brand as well as how long it will take a mystical character to craft it. A brand of power takes a number of Local turns to make equal to the focus area of the effect.


For example, If a supernatural effect is affecting a 4sq wide zone, then the character making the brand will require 4 Local turns or 1 World turn in order to complete it.


Activating a brand is a mental trigger and can be done once per turn whenever the creator wills it so long as they are within the focus range of the effect. Upon activation, the brand releases its stored effect upon anything within its focus area and is used up. However, a mystical character may reuse the brand the following turn by spending an equal amount of vigor towards the Focus action to reactivate it. Brands can only be activated by characters and creatures who obtained their curio from the same source.

Knowledge
Knowledge in the game of Mythical Monsters functions as a support towards Insight Tests. Having a rating in a given area of Knowledge grants Enhancement on Insight Tests equal to the rating. By default, all characters start with zero ratings in any given Knowledge.


KNOWLEDGE
	DESCRIPTION
	Culture
	Cultural Knowledge gives a character access to general details or rumors about cultures across the lands. This gives access to the traditions, mores, folkways, and beliefs that a given culture holds.
	History
	Historical Knowledge provides insight towards notable events that have happened between cultures, groups, or individuals in the past.
	Folklore
	Folklore tackles the realms of the supernatural, the given myths and practices concerning them, as well as the interactions between notable supernatural beings.
	Plants
	Knowledge in Plants grants general knowledge about plants, their inherent properties, and where they can be found.
	Animals
	Knowledge of Animals grants knowledge to the behavior of animals, their normal habitats, their capabilities, and their relationships with the cultures of the world.
	Lands
	Having knowledge of a Lands allows a character to gain insight on weather phenomena, geographic details, and the material forms that can be found within them.
	Languages
	Linguistic Knowledge allows a character to be able to converse fluently and understandably with some of the inhabitants of the world. Languages are unique in that one can possess Knowledge in multiple languages at once.
	Languages
By default, all characters possess fluency in a common tongue and are able to speak with one another with a basic understanding. However, depending on the scope of the game the Storyteller has put forth, encountering different cultures that speak different languages may be experienced.


If there are languages that are used in the world that the characters themselves would know about, then it is the prerogative of the Storyteller to inform you of those languages.


In these situations, a character needs to have a rating of 1 in Knowledge of a given culture’s Language in order to engage them on a basic level unless the culture has a reciprocal understanding of the common tongue
The Marketplace
  

During the Marketplace stage is when characters are able to purchase their items[n]. Every item in the game has an associated value called its market value. A character’s Wealth aspect plays a vital role here as it dictates what a character is capable of purchasing with their relative monetary power.
Items
The world of Mythical Monsters is fraught with creatures both great and terrible. Only with the assistance of items can one hope to match the chaos of the wild as well as the steppes of civilization. All items within Mythical Monsters have a size rating and a quality rating.


An item’s size rating represents both how large an item is and how much space it takes up when placed within a pack or container. Items with a size rating of zero such as rings, some trinkets, or letters have no impactful size or weight up to a reasonable degree. For instance, a Storyteller may deem that carrying around fifty rings or so merits a size rating.


An item’s quality rating represents both an item’s quality and its durability. As the game progresses, items can degrade or increase in quality. When an item’s quality rating reaches zero through whatever means, it is broken and cannot be used until repaired. 


The quality rating of an item generally ranges between 1 and 6, with each value being tied to a descriptor as shown below.


GRADE
	Decrepit
	Worn
	Average
	Fine
	Excellent
	Masterwork
	QUALITY RATING
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	6
	

Collections
An item can also be used to represent a Collection of items, as is the case with ammunition for ranged weapons, rations, or candles. Item Collections are depicted with an amount which determines how many of a given item equals its written size rating. When an item in a collection is used, the collection’s count is decreased by the amount used. If the current amount of an item falls below the listing’s amount, then its size rating decreases proportionately as well.


Item
	Size Rating
	Rarity
	Description
	Arrows (15)
	1
	0
	Used as Ammunition with Bows
	

In the listing above, 15 arrows equals a size rating of 1. Buying a second set of arrows would give a character 30 arrows, but raise the total size rating to 2. However, if an arrow were to be used, bringing the total down to 29, then the size rating would be 1.
Market Value
The market value serves as the rough approximation for how costly an item is to purchase using resources or a character’s Wealth aspect. An item’s market value is determined by taking the accumulated sum of its rarity ratings, the item’s size step, and the item’s quality rating. The lowest an item’s market value can possibly be is zero. If any modifiers cause the market value of an item to fall below zero, then its market value is set to zero.


The market value acts as the base price for an item. All interactions with the Marketplace will focus on shifting the market value of an item higher or lower than the base value.




MARKET VALUE
	RARITY + SIZE STEP + QUALITY
	



The rarity of an item represents both the scarcity of the material used as well as any additional classifications that modify the rarity of the item.


RARITY
	Common
	Uncommon
	Rare
	Very Rare
	Epic
	Legendary
	Mythical
	MARKET VALUE MODIFIER
	+0
	+1
	+2
	+3
	+4
	+5
	+6
	

The size step of an item represents the difference in size compared to an item made for a person of Average size. For example, Giant-sized items might cost more in a marketplace intended for Average-sized humans given the cost of materials. To determine an item’s size step, take the general size of the marketplace and count the number of steps to get from the marketplace’s size to the size of the item intended to be purchased.


ITEM SIZE
	Mini
	Tiny
	Small
	Little
	Average
	Giant
	Huge
	Colossal

	-4
	-3
	-2
	-1
	0
	+1
	+2
	+3
	+4
	 Size Step Table in an Average Marketplace


Additionally, an item can sometimes possess special details that enhance its market value further such as with historical artifacts, bejeweled or embroidered wares, or artisan goods. For example, a suit of armor embroidered with gems and trimmed with gold would have a higher material rarity than a simple suit made from steel alone. These can increase the market value further according to the Storyteller’s jurisdiction.
Buying from the Marketplace
To buy an item from the marketplace, a character first determines the market value of the item being set by the vendor. If the market value of an item is less than a character's Wealth rating, then the character can simply acquire the item if the vendor is willing to sell it to them.


However, if the market value of the item is equal to a character's Wealth rating, then they can spend a mark to acquire the item. If a character has no marks to spend, then they decrement their Wealth aspect by 1 but receive five marks.


If an item's market value is greater than the character's Wealth, then they are unable to afford it and cannot purchase it.
Selling to the Marketplace
To sell an item to the marketplace, a character first begins by determining the market value of the item itself. If the market value of the item is less than their Wealth rating, then they can simply sell the item and remove it from their pack.


However, if the market value of the item is equal or greater to their Wealth rating, then they can make a Market Test. In a Market Test, a character rolls a number of dice equal to the item's market value. Each success grants them a mark to their Wealth rating. When a character gains six marks towards Wealth, all marks are reset and a character's Wealth aspect increases by 1.


Unlike with physical and mental aspects, Market Tests cannot be influenced using vigor. However, the market value of an item can be affected by haggling and appraising.
Haggling
When buying and selling goods and services from the marketplace, the market value each can be influenced through haggling. Whether buying or selling, the interaction begins when the character starts a Resolve Contents with a vendor.


For haggling used towards buying an item, if the character earns more successes than the vendor, then the market value of the item is decreased by 1. If the character manages to earn at least double the successes of the vendor, then the market value of the item is decreased by 2 but no further.


Upon selling an item, if the character earns more successes than the vendor, then the market value of the item intended to be sold increases by 1. If the character manages to earn at least double the successes of the vendor, then the market value of the item increases by 2 but no further. If a vendor cannot afford the new market value of the item, then they may offer another item or a favor in addition to the deal.
________________


A character with a Wealth rating of 3 wants to sell an item with a market value of 3 to a vendor. The character starts by making a Resolve Test earning them 3 successes. The vendor then makes their own Resolve Test and manages to earn 2 successes. Because the character managed to gain more successes than the vendor, the market value of the item can be increased by 1 to 4. They then make a Market Test to sell the item and roll four dice earning them 3 successes which earns them 3 marks towards their Wealth rating. 
________________


Appraising
When a player arrives at a vendor in the marketplace, they will be given a market value for any items they wish to purchase. However, by making an Insight Test, they can determine if a vendor's market value is the true market value. If a character possesses a relevant rating in a profession, the Insight Test can receive Enhancement equal to character's rating in that profession.


Each success earned in the Insight Test allows them to learn whether the market value of the item is equal to or greater than their achieved result.

The world of Mythical Monsters is one that is fraught with dangers and peril thus weapons are necessary to steel against the foes that lurk in shadow. Weapons are a type of item therefore they have a size and a quality rating. 


The Quality rating of a weapon represents its durability. Whenever a character makes a Weapon Action and achieves a Minor or Major Blunder using vigor, the weapon’s quality decreases by 1. If the quality rating of the weapon reaches zero, then the weapon breaks.


Arms in the game have three particular properties: a Weapon Class, a Weapon Subclass, and a Size rating. A weapon’s Class determines what Actions it grants to its wielder. There are three Weapon Classes: Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, and Shields.


When buying Arms, select a Material, a Weapon Class, and a Subclass. The Material’s Rarity, the Subclasses’ Rarity, and the item’s Quality itself form the Market Value of the weapon. Each weapon comes along with a sheath and a strap that allow them to be fitted onto belts, over shoulders, or along backs.

Subclasses
The subclass of a weapon determines how it is handled by its wielder. Light weapons are small weapons that can only be used in one hand. Versatiles weapons are weapons large enough to be wielded in one or two hands but require different Strength ratings in each case. Heavy weapons can only be wielded by using both hands. If a character's Strength rating meets the Strength requirement of a weapon, then they can use the weapon's Size rating as Enhancement towards a Contested action.

________________


A character with a Strength rating of 3 can wield any Heavy Weapon with no issue. Whenever they make an Attack, the character can roll 3 dice from their Strength and 3 additional dice from the weapon’s Size rating.


A character with a Strength rating of 2 using a Heavy Weapon would not be able to use the weapon’s Size rating as Enhancement and can only roll the 2 dice afforded to them by their Strength rating.
________________


Throwing
In order to throw a weapon or item at a target, the target must be within the thrower’s base range. A creature’s base range is the maximum distance they can toss the item and starts at a range of 0ft. For every point that a character's Strength rating exceeds the size rating of the thrown item, their base range increases by 5ft/1sq. A character can use a Contested action to make a Strength Test to increase this range equal to 5ft/1sq per success obtained. 


Once a target is inside a creature's base range, the creature then uses a Contested action to make a Finesse Test in order to throw the object. If a character's Strength is equal or greater than the Size rating of the object, then the character's Finesse Test gains Enhancement equal to the Size rating of the item. 
________________


A character with a Strength rating of 3 and a Finesse rating of 3 wants to throw a dagger at a target 10ft away from them. A dagger has a size rating of 1 so the character’s base range with the weapon is 10ft/2sq. Because the target is in the character’s base range, 


The character then uses a Contested action to make a Finesse Test. Because the character’s Strength rating is greater or equal to the Strength requirement of the item, they gain Enhancement towards the Test equal to the item’s size, which in this case is 1.
________________


Dual Wielding
A character can wield multiple weapons if their hands are available and they satisfy the Strength requirement of the weapons themselves. When making Weapon actions with multiple weapons, only one Contested action is made at a time. However, the character gains Enhancement equal to the size ratings of both weapons.
________________


A character with a Strength rating of 2 wielding two daggers would make a Strength Test to perform a Slash and then add the Size rating of each dagger they are using for a total of 4 towards Enhancement on the Test.
________________


The Enhancement provided by using more than one weapon in this fashion can be used towards Pressure or Resistance in a given Turn but not both.

Ranged weapons are used to send a piece of ammunition at a target from a distance. The use of any ranged weapon requires the use of both hands.

The Ready action is a free action that loads one piece of ammunition from a character’s pack or quiver into a ranged weapon. 


The Aim action allows a character to use a Contested Action to make a Finesse Test in order to increase the default base range of the ranged weapon. Each success earned in the Finesse Test increases the character’s base range with the weapon by one additional square (5ft). 


The Loose action lets a character spend one readied piece of ammunition to use a Contested action to make a ranged Weapon action against a target within the character’s range. For this, a character makes a Finesse Test to create piercing physical pressure. If the character’s Strength rating is equal to or greater than the size rating of the ranged weapon, they may add the weapon’s size rating as Enhancement to this Test.


If a character’s Strength rating is less than the Strength Requirement of the weapon, then they cannot use the weapon’s Size rating as Enhancement.


The Hold action is a free action that allows a character to turn the Loose action into a Concentrated action and keep successes obtained for the following Engagement turn. The Hold action is useful in situations where a character wants to prepare a shot for a target that will be inside their base range in the next Engagement turn. In order to use the Hold action, a character must succeed on a Strength Check. If the character fails, then the ammunition is spent and they must ready another. Crossbows do not require a Strength Check in order to perform the Hold action.
________________


A character with a Strength and Finesse rating of 2 wants to loose an arrow with their Shortbow at a foe. The foe is within base range of the weapon (60ft/12sq) of the character so they do not need to spend their Contested action to aim. 


The character starts by using a Free action to ready an arrow. Then they use a Contested action to make a Finesse Test to loose the arrow at their target. Because their Strength rating matches the size rating of the weapon, they can use the weapon’s size rating of 2 as Enhancement on the Test.

Shields
Shields are a hybrid between weapons and armor as they can be used for both offense and defense. To construct a shield, first choose a shield material and then determine its size rating. A shield’s size rating can serve as Enhancement whenever a character makes a Contested action to create physical resistance or as Enhancement to a Contest. Shields can also function as a melee weapon and get access to all of the Weapon Actions that entail so long as the shield fits the criteria for each Weapon Action.

Armor is the basis of protection within the world of Mythical Monsters. Common materials for armor generally include all types of Material. In the game, armor is represented by a character’s Armor Set.


To build an Armor Set, start by choosing one Material and then pair it with an Armor Type that matches its Material Class below. Record the corresponding details of each Material and Armor Type to the Armor Set entry on the character’s sheet.

Armor Details are parts of an Armor Set that a player can determine for themselves. These could take the form of a special Helm of some sentimental value or a particular engraving that makes their breastplate stand out from the rest. They have no effect on the Armor Set itself.

Apparel consists of what a character wears beneath their armor. Clothing, jewelry, or items of particular make fall readily into this category. Here the player is at liberty to come up with what their character typically wears. As with all items, Apparel is sized for the species it was designed for and has a quality rating. The quality of one’s apparel can be useful to influence the opinions of nobility or to blend in with a common crowd.


The limits of Apparel are mostly consigned to the boundaries of common sense. For example, a character with two hands can really only wear two gloves unless magical mutations or supernatural trickery grants them a third.
Packs
Packs are containers that allow characters to carry more on their person than their arms, armor, and apparel. Backpacks, satchels, bags, coin purses, and even carts represent packs that facilitate the containment of items every adventurer needs to continue their journeys.

Packs, apart from having a quality and a size of their own, also possess a Capacity. This capacity value represents the maximum cumulative size it can carry.
________________


An average backpack has a Capacity of 8 which represents the maximum Total Size it can carry. Inserting any other items would not fit or would completely overflow out of the pack entirely.

In the backpack above, the Total Size of all the items within the pack comes out to 5. Because the Capacity of the Backpack is 8, it still has more room for items if a player needs them.
________________




A pack cannot contain an item that is larger than its own size and characters cannot wear packs that are of equal or larger size than they are. However, you can certainly have packs inside other packs. In these instances, the pack’s Size rating is used rather than its capacity.
Encumbrance
A character can wear as many packs as is within reasonable boundaries of the imagination. If the Total Size of the items a character is carrying exceeds their Carrying Capacity, then the character’s Movement is hindered by the margin. 


In addition, any Encumbrance a character has also acts as Hindrance to all Tests based on Physical Aspects.
Lights
The world of Mythical Monsters, while fantastical, is full of monsters and creatures that prowl in the night. For many creatures, darkness hinders wits and so light is needed. In order for a light source to be used, it must either be placed upon a surface or held in at least one hand.


Items that provide lighting cast out a radiance which represents the number of squares of unhindered vision for creatures with normal vision.


  
 
An example of a Torch with a radiance of 3


Each turn that a light source is lit or casts illumination, its quality decreases by 1. When a light source’s quality reaches zero, then it is used up and it no longer casts light.

________________


On one turn, a character decides to light up a Wax candle with a Quality rating of 3 to help them explore a dark dungeon. The light casts a radiance that allows them to see in 2 squares all around them. As the next turn passes though, the candle melts and so its quality goes from 3 to 2.


After five more turns have passed, the candle snuffs out and the character must either light another candle or brave the dungeon’s depths in the dark.
________________


Rations
This section describes rations which are used to stave off fatigue and restore vigor when they are used in the Exploration and Travel stages of gameplay.


Traveling on the road can result in times where one does not have the luxury of a tavern or a home cooked meal to warm them against the nightly cold. For this purpose, many adventurers and journeymen carry around rations. In Mythical Monsters, rations represent a combination of a character’s food and water supply.


Eating rations reduces a character’s Fatigue by 1 and increases their vigor equal to the quality of the rations. Upon using rations, the amount of rations decreases by 1. However, if a character goes a day without eating Rations, then their Fatigue increases by 1 the next day.


Rations can be used as many times as the characters feel necessary but they can only be used during the Exploration or Travel stages during Rests, not during Engagements. When a ration’s Quality rating has been reduced to zero, it is used up.

Staying at a tavern can provide benefits in the forms of a place to rest and a level of quality care. The Market Value of a tavern indicates the level of Wealth a character must possess in order to stay one night at the establishment. In exchange for staying at the tavern, the character can use the Quality rating of the tavern as Enhancement on their Endurance Tests during a Rest.
Enchantments
In addition to an item’s size and quality ratings, it is possible for items to be equipped with Enchantments as well. Enchantments imbue an object with supernatural abilities or properties and function independently of the object itself. Additionally, if the object’s own Quality rating reaches 0 and becomes broken, then the Enchantment will also cease to function until the object is restored.


All enchantments have six properties: Quality, Supernatural Effect, Focus Power, Focus Area, Focus Range, and Focus Duration.


The Quality rating represents the durability of the enchantment in the face of nullifying magics as well as the number of times an Enchantment can be invoked. When an Enchantment has been invoked as many times as its Quality rating, it ceases to function until restored.


The Supernatural Effect describes what the Enchantment is designed to do. This will declare the supernatural practice being used and the specific supernatural keyword being utilized. In this fashion, enchanted items can share enchantments but may do completely different things. Look to the Supernatural Aspects section for additional details.


The Power represents the potency of the Supernatural Effect as per the Focus Action. What this Focus Power represents will depend on the Supernatural Effect’s description.


The Focus Area represents how many squares the Supernatural Effect covers as per the Focus Action.


The Range represents the range of squares the Focus Area can be moved from the object’s location as per the Focus Action.


The Duration represents the amount of Turns the Supernatural Effect persists for before expiring. This will include whether this timeframe encompasses Engagement, Local, or World Turns.


Enchantments will increase an item’s Rarity by the sum of its Quality rating and total Focus. To calculate the total Focus, add up the Focus Power, Area, Range, and Duration together.

Recharging Enchantments
Enchantments can be restored by one charge by either spending enough vigor equal to the amount of Focus in the Enchantment or waiting a number of World Turns equal to the total Focus of the Enchantment
Allies
Determine Allies


Allies define the breadth of a character’s social influence within the game. A normal character might not be willing to help a player character in their time of need but an Ally would certainly try to provide assistance in some form or fashion.


Within the game Allies are People, Factions, or Communities a player can rely on for providing some help towards an action related to the Ally’s Trade. Similar to a character’s Profession, an Ally’s Trade represents their level of expertise in a given area of society. There are fourteen Trades that an Ally can be associated with:


Agriculture    Art    Crafts    Criminal    Entertainment    Government    Medicine   Merchant Military    Religion    Sailor    Scholarship    Service    Vagabond


While Allies that represent Factions or Communities may at large be tied to a particular Trade, that does not mean that the individuals within the collective cannot be called upon for unique insights. For example, one member of a Criminal organization might possess knowledge about Art but this is something handled during play between the player character and the Storyteller.

Engagements
  

Engagements are used to fast-paced or time critical events. While combat is the first intuitive notion for engagements, they also encompass perils, chases, and other extreme situations where the order of action matters.
Surprise
At the beginning of an engagement, the Storyteller evaluates if a surprise is able to be granted. Most forms of surprise occur when one group in stealth begins the engagement by making a number of actions towards another group.


When a surprise occurs, all creatures involved in the surprise gain one Engagement turn to perform Actions. All creatures on the receiving end of the surprise cannot perform Actions and are unable to muster resistance to any Contested Actions received on that turn. Once all creatures initiating the surprise have gone, all involved parties are added to the Turn Order.
The Turn Order
After all surprises have been handled, all players and opposing forces involved in the engagement are sorted in descending order according to their Wits rating. During this stage, players can choose to bolster their Wits rating by spending vigor to increase their position in the order.


In a tie, the players have superiority, meaning that if a player and an opposing force earn the same result, then the player goes first. If two players tie, then they decide between themselves who goes first.
Your Moment
Engagement turns have their own special time span known as moments. In one moment, a creature can take three Free Actions, one Contested Action, and as many Move Actions as they are capable of taking.


As mentioned in the Myths & Dice section, there are three kinds of Actions: Free Actions, Contested Actions, and Move Actions.


Free Action
	A Free Action is an action that has no obstacles associated with it and costs no vigor. In an Engagement, a given creature can only make three Free Actions per Turn.
	Speak
	Speaking within an engagement produces a short amount of dialogue that can be used to signal intent, speak with the opposing party, or relay fear at the sight of a big intimidating creature. When a creature uses a Free action to speak with another creature, the opposing creature may reply for free.
	Perceive
	Perceiving allows a character either to make a Wits Test to overcome a hindering element of the environment or make an observation and acquire details about a present area, creature, or object. If they possess a relevant knowledge or profession, they can also make an Insight Test to learn any details or clues regarding a creature or situation.
	Rest
	A rest allows a creature to reduce their Fatigue and Wounds by 1. This is negated if the character spends vigor or takes damage
	Interact with Object
	Drawing a weapon, opening an unlocked door, or grabbing an object on one’s person are examples of free actions.
	Use Item
	Using an item other than a weapon counts as a free action unless it is otherwise specified.
	



Contested Action
	Contested Actions are actions that are obstructed by some obstacle and require the use of a Test and possibly even vigor in order to overcome them. A given creature can only start one Contested Action per Engagement turn.Other creatures can then contribute towards the same Contest by making Assisting Actions.
	Weapon Action
	Use a weapon to make one Weapon action to create physical pressure against another creature. The Weapon actions a character has available to them depends on the Weapon’s class (Melee, Ranged, Shield).
	Brace
	Use an aspect to create physical resistance or condition resistance during your turn.
	Cause Condition
	Apply an Aspect to create conditional pressure.
	Perform Maneuver
	Apply an Aspect to perform a special maneuver
	Retreat
	Signal a Retreat that other players can immediately respond to. This turns the Engagement into a Chase.
	Focus
	Use a Supernatural Practice to create a supernatural effect by spending vigor or resources to accrue focus points.
	

Making a Contested Action
Inflicting physical pressure, causing conditional pressure, or performing maneuvers are forms of  Contested Actions. Contested Actions occur whenever one side is creating pressure which forces the other side to answer with resistance. In an Engagement turn, a character can either start one Contested Action towards an uncontested target or assist in another’s Contested Action.


There are three kinds of pressure a character can exert: Physical Pressure, Natural Pressure, or Conditional Pressure.


Physical Pressure is created when a creature makes a Weapon Action or attempts to cause Piercing, Slashing, or Bludgeoning damage to a target. Physical Pressure is accumulated together meaning that if a character receives both Piercing Pressure and Slashing Pressure in a Round, the Pressure is summed together into a cumulative amount of Physical Pressure. Any pressure that a creature has received will convert into Wounds when the World Turns.


Natural Pressure is created when a creature uses a natural element such as Fire, Cold, Acid, or Magic to damage a target. Each form of Natural Pressure is considered individually. This means that if a character receives Fire Pressure and Cold Pressure in a Round, they are evaluated separately. Any natural pressure a character has received will turn into ranks of a natural condition


Movement Pressure is pressure designed to move a character from their current position to another position. If this 


Conditional Pressure is created when a creature makes an Action or uses an Aspect to cause another target to suffer a Physical or Mental Condition. Weapon Actions can also be used to create Conditional Pressure if they are used in an appropriate way such as using a club to try and inflict Stun pressure.


If a creature receives any form of pressure before the turn order is through, then they will be unable to use Move actions until all of the pressure they’ve sustained has been fully resisted or negated.


Assists
If a Contested Action was started by another player or creature during a Round in the Engagement, then another player or creature can contribute to the Contested Action by using their Turn to add to the side of the Contest they wish to assist with.


For example, if one character made a Slash Weapon Action towards a creature on one Engagement turn and created 4 points of Physical Pressure and then another character on their turn made a Slash Weapon Action to create 2 additional points of Physical Pressure, then both would be accumulated together to make 6 points of Pressure.
Making a Move Action
Move Action
	A Move Action allows a creature to move 5ft/1sq of distance. A character starts their turn with a number of Move Actions equal to their Size rating + Endurance rating. 


A character can take more Move Actions but at a cost of one point of vigor per Move Action.
	

During your Turn, you can move a number of squares equal to your character’s Size rating plus their Endurance rating. A character can move beyond this allotted amount by spending one point of vigor for each additional square moved. If a character has not gained Fatigue on their Turn, then they gain one point of Fatigue from this action.
Maneuvers
Maneuvers are special Contested Actions that allow characters to influence another creature’s positioning through the use of Aspects.


Shove
A Shove maneuver is used to push another creature or object a number of squares. In order to Shove a creature, you must make a Strength Test which can be resisted. For every success you earn, the target is shoved 5ft/1sq.


Trip
A Trip maneuver is used to cause another creature to either fall or waver in balance. In order to Trip a creature, you must make a Finesse Test which can be resisted by the target. If the target fails to resist the maneuver, then they gain ranks of the Staggered condition equal to the margin.


Charge
A Charge maneuver is used to give Enhancement to an action through the use of Movement along a surface. In order to make a Charge maneuver, a creature must move a number of squares equal to twice their size rating. This movement must be unimpeded and running through anything with movement resistance such as a Snare negates the charge.


Once this has been accomplished, a creature can use their size rating as Enhancement towards an Action using a physical aspect.


Plummet
A Plummet maneuver is used to give Enhancement to an action through falling. In order to use a Plummet, a character must fall a number of squares equal to their size rating.


Once this has been accomplished, a creature can use their Size rating as Enhancement towards the character’s next Weapon Action.


Swap
A Swap maneuver is used when one character wants to switch places with another. Both characters must be within one Size Step of one another in order for a swap to occur. This consumes a Free action from both participants.
Delay Turn
Once a creature’s Turn has been reached in the Turn Order, they gain the ability to delay making a Contested Action. A delay allows a creature to suspend their turn until after another creature in the turn order has gone.


Delaying a Turn can prove useful when coordinating efforts against particular foes or for observing how an Engagement unfolds before choosing to make an Action.
Resistance
Where there is pressure, there is resistance. When a character or creature is on the receiving end of a Contested Action, they can respond by creating resistance. The resistance a character creates must match the type of pressure being exerted against them (Physical, Natural, or Conditional). However, if the Contested Action is assisted by another creature, then the resisting creature may apply vigor after the Assist has been rolled.


When a creature creates Resistance, they choose an Action that matches the type of Pressure being exerted upon them. A physical Weapon Action can be resisted by a physical Weapon Action or through the use of a Physical Aspect.
________________


A character being attacked by another creature’s Weapon Action can make a Weapon Action of their own as Resistance. This Test becomes their total Resistance for the Turn. However, if another enemy creature made an Assist to the first creature’s Weapon Action, then the character would be able to respond by either spending vigor to try and increase their Resistance or waiting until an ally was able to Assist with Resistance as well.
________________




Physical Resistance
Physical Pressure is made with the intent to cause physical damage and can only be responded to with Physical Resistance. This Physical Resistance can take the form of a complimentary Weapon Action or the use of a Physical Aspect. If the Physical Pressure on a target manages to exceed their Physical Resistance, then the target must make an Armor Test.


Armor Tests
Armor Tests allow a character receiving Physical Pressure to use their Armor to absorb some of the incoming damage. If the type of Physical Pressure being applied matches a Physical Vulnerability of an Armor Set, the target must make an Armor Test and roll a number of dice equal to the Armor Set’s Armor rating. Each success earned reduces the incoming Physical Pressure by 1.


However, if the Physical Pressure applied does not match an Armor Set’s Physical Vulnerabilities, then the target does not need to roll any dice and can reduce Physical Pressure equal to the Armor Set’s Armor rating.


An Armor Test can only be used once per type of Physical Pressure (Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning). 
________________


A character with an Iron Plate Armor Set has an Armor rating of 3 and is only vulnerable to attacks that deal Bludgeoning damage. If an enemy combatant makes a Slash against the character and manages to exceed the character’s Resistance, then the character’s Armor Set will absorb 3 successes when the Armor Test is made.


However, if the attack had instead been a Bludgeoning attack, then the player would need to roll 3 dice for the Armor Set’s Armor rating with each success lessening the incoming Physical Pressure by 1.
________________




Natural Resistance
In a world of natural and supernatural forces, a character can be expected to face against more than blades. Certain Armor Sets are equipped with Natural Resistances based on the Materials they are made from or the Supernatural Power they’ve been enchanted with.


An Armor Set’s Natural Resistances represents the number of successes it negates when struck by a given amount of Pressure of that matching Damage Type. If a character’s Armor Set does not have a Natural Resistance to the Damage Type tied with a Weapon Action, then the character has an effective Resistance of 0 towards that damage and may suffer a Condition based on the Damage Type.


Practices
Practices can also be utilized towards increasing Resistance on Tests. For example, the Parrying Speciality provides Enhancement towards Resistance when a Finesse Test is made. In this example, a character would be able to enhance their Finesse Test using a number of dice equal to their rating in the Parrying Speciality.


Cover
Characters can also take advantage of their environment and use surrounding objects as cover to increase their Resistance to incoming attacks. To use Cover, the Storyteller determines the appropriate amount of Cover and how much it hinders incoming attacks.


Generally, most forms of cover will provide Enhancement towards Resistance equal to their Size rating.
Retreating
A Retreat is a special Action that a player can declare during an Engagement to signal an escape. When a player signals a Retreat, all other players in the Engagement can choose to participate in the Retreat or remain in the Engagement.


Players that join the Retreat immediately take their Turn after the signaling character even if their Turn has already gone. Retreating characters cannot make Contested Actions to cause Pressure and can only make Move Actions.


Players that remain in the Engagement continue to follow the established Turn Order until they either Retreat themselves or become unable to.
The World Turns
Once all active participants in the Engagement have had their Moment, the World Turns. During this Turn, all participants in an Engagement take any Pressure they have accumulated during the Round and subtract generated Resistance. If there is a margin of Pressure, the margin added to a character’s Wounds rating. If the amount of Wounds a character has received exceeds their Death’s Door threshold, then they subtract an amount of vigor equal to the margin and reset their Wounds rating to the threshold.


For example, if a character was successfully hit by a burning Torch during the Round and received Fire Pressure, they will add the amount of Fire Pressure to their Wounds rating.


Once all Pressure has been applied, all Pressure generated in the Round is reset to zero.
Recovery
Once the World Turns, all active participants in the Engagement gain Recovery. A character regains vigor equal to their Recovery rating minus their current Fatigue.
________________


A character with a Recovery rating of 3 and a Fatigue of 2 regains 1 vigor during Recovery.
________________


Characters suffering from Conditions can make Endurance Tests and Resolve Tests to recover from Physical and Mental Conditions respectively. The amount of successes earned from a Test reduces the inflicted Condition’s rank by the achieved amount. 


Only one Physical Condition and one Mental Condition can be recovered in this fashion. For example, if a character gained the Staggered Condition and the Stunned Condition during a Round, they must choose which Condition they are going to apply their Endurance Test towards during Recovery. However, if a character is both Stunned and Distracted, then they can make both an Endurance Test and a Resolve Test during Recovery.
Size Step
Size plays an important factor in the world of Mythical Monsters, as some creatures can be as tall as giants or as small as fairies. When taking Actions against such creatures, one needs to know the size step. The size step is the difference in size (or “steps”) between two creatures.


When two creatures of the same size interact, the size step becomes 0. However, if an Average person were to face against a Giant creature, then the size step becomes 1. See the table below for more examples.


SIZE
	SIZE RATING
	TACTICAL SIZE
	HEIGHT RANGE
	WEIGHT RANGE
	Mini
	0
	0 Squares

	16 tons–125 tons
	Mythical
	8
	5+ by 5+ Squares 
	64’ or more
	125 tons or more
	

Larger creatures can use the size step as enhancement towards actions that use physical aspects, whereas smaller creatures can use the Size Step as resistance against actions that use physical aspects.
Ending Engagements
There are four conditions that can end an Engagement:


* Surrender - When all active creatures in a group decide to end the engagement, leaving their fate in the hands of another group. For example, a group of creatures may all decide to appeal to mercy or a parley.
* Defeat - When there are no more active creatures of a group left to contribute to the engagement.
* Natural Causes - When there is no way for creatures to interact with each other in the engagement. 
* Retreat - When a group of creatures have fled from the area of Engagement.


When an Engagement ends, the stage of play shifts back to the Exploration stage.
Progression
Earning Marks
As characters engage in the world of Mythical Monsters, they will undoubtedly experience moments of growth both physically and mentally. In the game, this growth is measured in terms of marks.


Characters gain a mark when they earn a Minor Success or a Major Success while spending vigor to use a Physical, Mental, or Supernatural aspect towards a challenge.


Characters gain a mark when they apply either a Physical, Mental, or Supernatural aspect and spend vigor equal to their current rating in the aspect and earn a Minor Success or a Major Success. 
________________


A character with a Strength of 2 needs to spend 2 vigor and either obtain a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder in order to earn one mark.


Alternatively, a character with the Magical Practice of Create Fire at a rating of 2 must spend 2 vigor towards Focus Power (on top of Ease that they earn from their practice) and obtain a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder in order to earn one mark
________________




When a character has earned six marks in a given Aspect, then the Aspect increases by 1 and the amount of marks obtained reset to zero.
Improving Professions, Knowledge, or Practices
Aspects are not the only things that can be improved with marks. A character can also gain marks towards improving Professional skill, Knowledge, or a Practice.


In order to earn a mark towards these characteristics, they must be incorporated into a Contested Action where vigor was spent. If the spent vigor results in a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder then the character gains a mark towards those applied characteristics. This also means it is possible for a character to gain marks towards both aspects and characteristics at the same time.


________________


A character with an Insight of 3 and Knowledge (Folklore) 2 must spend at least 2 vigor towards applying Insight related to Myths and obtain a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder.


If only 2 vigor is spent and obtains a special result, then only the Knowledge (Folklore) can receive a mark. If three are rolled, then both Knowledge (Folklore) and the applied aspect receive a mark.
________________


Learning New Skills
Characters can also learn new professions, new Knowledge, and new Practices that they did not possess before. In order to learn a new skill, a character must be in an environment where they can learn the new skill or knowledge.


The character must then make an Insight Check. When a character has succeeded on six consecutive Insight Checks in this fashion, they can increase their new Skill rating from 0 to 1. However, if any of the Insight Checks fail during this process, then they must start over.


Characters with the skills that another is trying to train in can assist in this by applying their relevant Profession, Knowledge, or Practice towards the other’s roll.
Obtaining Mastery
When an Aspect, Profession, Knowledge, or Practice manages to get enough Marks to surpass a rating of 6, it gains a rank of Mastery. A rank of Mastery allows a character to gain Ease towards that respective characteristic equal to the rank of Mastery. When a character gains a rank in this fashion, the marks for that characteristic reset and then the character must earn a number of marks equal to their rating plus the ranks of Mastery they possess in it.


For example, if a character had 2 ranks of Mastery in their Strength Aspect, then every time they used the Strength Aspect, they would get 2 Ease (or 2 automatic successes) towards performing the Action.
Downtime
After the characters have returned from their adventure, the Storyteller may provide Downtime to the players to do with as they wish. In Downtime, the rules of the game relax and the focus becomes the individual activities of the characters outside the scope of the usual adventure. This section covers some activities characters can perform during their own Downtime.
Training
During downtime, characters can choose to spend their time honing their Aspects, Professions, Knowledge, or Practices. In order to gain the benefits of training, a character must spend at least one week fully concentrated on the task and must have the means and materials to improve the ability being trained. After one week of training, a character gains one Ease towards improving at the ability of their choice. Once this Ease has been gained, the character can either make a Test using a number of dice equal to their rating using this Ease or they can save the Ease for the following week.


If a character decides to take the Test, then they must earn a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder. Ease is then applied to the roll and replaces any Blunders with successes as if the character had rolled a 5 instead. Ease used in this fashion is lost if the roll is anything other than a Major or Minor.


However, if a character decides not to make a Test and to instead hold onto their Ease from training, they can opt to spend the Ease instead towards acquiring a rank outright. Once a character has acquired enough Ease equal to the rating of the Aspect being trained, they can spend the Ease altogether and earn a Mark.


Once a character has earned a Mark, all Ease acquired from training is reset. 
________________


A character spending a week of training Strength 2 gains one Ease at the end of that week. They can then decide to spend the Ease towards a Strength Test or hold onto the Ease for another week.


If they choose to make a Test, they must roll 2 dice and earn a Minor Success, Major Success, Minor Blunder, or Major Blunder. The one Ease is then used to convert one Blunder into one Success for the sake of achieving this. If the character manages to earn one of the special rolls, then they gain a Mark towards Strength and all Ease is reset. Upon failing however, all Ease is reset and the character must spend another week training.


If the character decides to wait another week and gain another point of Ease though, they can spend the 2 Ease saved towards automatically earning a Mark in Strength instead.
________________


Mentoring
Characters can also choose to assist characters training in Downtime by providing mentorship in the relevant Aspects, Professions, Knowledge, or Practices. In order for a character to mentor another, they must satisfy two conditions: They must possess a rating in the associated ability equal to or greater to the character receiving the mentorship and they must succeed on an Insight Check after a week of mentoring the characters in question.


If the mentoring character succeeds on the Insight Check, then the mentored character gains an additional point of Ease towards their training. However, if the mentoring character fails, then they provide a point of Hindrance to the mentored character. This Hindrance only lasts for the week and does not affect the mentored character’s accumulated Ease.
________________


Consider a case where a Mentor with Strength 3 Insight 1 is mentoring another character with  Strength 2. After one week has passed, the mentored character gains one Ease. The Mentor must then make an Insight Check and earn one success.


If the Mentor succeeds on the Insight Check, then the mentored character gains an additional point of Ease and would be able to spend it on a Mark. However, if the Mentor fails, then the mentored character gains Hindrance for that week and wouldn’t be able to get the Mark until after another week of training.
________________


Working
Characters looking to improve their Wealth Aspect can choose to work their Profession during Downtime. Characters that spend a week working in a profession they have a rating in can make a Profession Test. Any successes earned from this test carry on to the next week and are cumulative. Once a character has earned more successes than their Wealth rating, their Wealth rating increases by 1 and all successes earned thus far are reset.
Researching
Downtime is also the perfect time to research mysteries or intriguing discoveries made over the course of the previous adventure. Characters are at liberty to move around in the setting and apply their Aspects and Knowledge where they can serve to illuminate whatever ails their curiosity. Any traveling or expenses are handled as they would be during normal play.
Crafting
Crafting allows for the players and their characters to create their own means of supply. There are three requirements for crafting any item within the game: Materials, a rating in a relevant Profession, and a Toolkit.


The Materials serve as the material components of the item. For most items, there is one core material with any others simply being auxiliary or to embellish the item with finer details.


To craft an item though, one needs knowledge and experience in a Profession that makes the item. For example, a blade can only be made by someone with experience as a Blacksmith or a Bladesmith.


And finally, a Toolkit is needed to craft the item itself. For blades, a blacksmithing toolkit or a forge is required. For making potions, an alchemy toolkit is needed. Toolkits themselves are items that can be made but may require materials of their own.


Once all three requirements have been met, a character can begin crafting their very own items. To begin, the character determines the Rarity of the Material and the Rarity of the item type and together these form the Crafting challenge rating.


Each week that a character spends crafting allows them to make a Profession Test with each success contributing towards overcoming the Crafting CR. Vigor cannot be used towards this Test. These successes are cumulative meaning all of the successes earned from Profession Tests each week are added together  towards the matching the Crafting CR. Once the Crafting CR is met, the item’s quality increases by 1 and any excess successes contribute towards increasing the quality again.


However, if any of the Profession Tests result in Minor Blunders, then the item’s quality decreases by 1. If the result is a Major Blunder, then the materials become unusable.


If a Minor Success, Major Success, Minor Blunder, or Major Blunder are achieved during the Profession Test, then the character gains a mark towards their applied Profession.


Enchanting
Just as items can be crafted, so can enchantments. An enchantment is a supernatural effect engraved into an item of the enchanter's choosing.


In order to enchant an item, a character must have a rating in a Supernatural Practice (Magical, Divine, or Mystical). To begin enchanting, the enchanter first determines the nature of the enchantment through the use of Focus as if they were making use of their Supernatural Practice. Focus Power applied to the Enchantment will only be used in the way that the enchanter prescribes it.


The determined amount of Focus serves as the Crafting challenge rating of the Enchantment. Once a week of crafting has transpired, the enchanter must make an Enchanting Test where their applied Supernatural Practice rating equals the number of dice to roll. Vigor cannot be used towards this Test either. Refer to the table below for calculating the Crafting challenge rating for the Enchantment.
FOCUS ASPECT
	COST
	FOCUS POWER
	Amount of dice to be rolled when invoked.
	FOCUS AREA
	0 if the effect is self-targeted or is directed at an adjacent target. Otherwise, use the Longest Dimension
	FOCUS RANGE
	0 if the effect is self-targeted or manifests from the object’s location. Otherwise, increase this by 1 to place the Focus Area within 6sq/30ft increments
	FOCUS DURATION
	The maximum amount of Turns the effect is to persist. Multiply this amount by the Turn type multiplier.
	



TURN TYPE MULTIPLIER
	Engagements (1)
	Local (2)
	World (3)
	

The results of the Enchanting Test are concentrated meaning each success earned adds to the total result for the Test. However, if a character obtains a Minor or Major Blunder, then all successes are reset. Once a character has acquired enough successes equal to the Crafting challenge rating of the Enchantment, the Enchantment's Quality rating increases from 0 to 1.


The Enchantment's Quality rating indicates that the Enchantment is active and also represents the amount of times it can be used before it needs to be recharged.
________________


Consider a case where a character with a rating of 2 in the Supernatural Practice of Create Fire wants to give their sword an Enchantment that will cause it to become shrouded with flames. They begin by determining the amount of Focus applied with their Storyteller.


Because the effect is targeting the object itself, the Focus Area can be considered 0. The Focus Range is also 0 because the effect isn’t going beyond the sword. That leaves the Duration and the Focus Power.


For example’s sake, we’ll say that the character chooses a Duration of 3 Turns and uses 3 Focus Power when invoked. That places the Crafting challenge rating of the Enchantment at 6. This means after each week of enchanting the sword, the crafter makes a Test using a number of dice equal to their rating in the Supernatural Practice. After they have managed to obtain 6 successes, the Enchantment’s quality increases from 0 to 1 and they gain the ability to invoke it.
________________




The Natural World
Natural Damage
Natural Damage represents the range of natural damage types that can be found in the Natural World. Unlike Physical Damage, which comprises Slashing, Piercing, and Bludgeoning, Natural Damage inflicts wounds and conditions.


Fire - Creatures that take Fire damage receive wounds equal to the level of Fire produced and gain the Burning condition equal to the level of Fire.


Cold - Creatures that take Cold damage receive wounds equal to the level of Cold applied and receive the Freezing condition equal to the level of Cold.


Acid - Creatures that take Acid damage receive wounds equal to the level of Acid applied. If the level of Acid is more than a creature’s Armor Set’s Natural Resistance, then the creature selects a piece of the Armor Set and reduces its quality equal to the difference.
The Environment
The world of Mythical Monsters is not always one basked in the light of day. Adventurers and would-be heroes can come to expect darkness and dangerous perils on their journey. This section covers how aspects of the Environment can affect play. 
Vision
A day in the world of Mythical Monsters is composed of six Turns. The first four of these Turns take place within broad daylight, but the last two are enveloped by darkness.


The lighting in a scene can affect Actions taken by a creature depending on their vision. For example, a creature with Common Vision can see without obstacles in Daylight and Bright Light. However, in Dim Light and Darkness, performing Actions is indeed by the amount indicated in the table below unless the creature makes a Wits Test for the Turn. For each success a character earns from the Test, the Hindrance is lowered by 1. Any remaining hindrance is stacked against Actions performed by the creature on that Turn.


If a character performs an Action against a creature in a differently lit square, then they must make the Wits Test against the hindrance of that square’s lighting.


Lighting
	Common Vision Hindrance
	Night Vision Hindance
	Examples
	Daylight
	0
	6
	Sunlight
	Bright Light
	0
	6
	Torchlight, candles, lamps, fire
	Dim Light
	1

	A moonlit night
	Dark
	6
	0
	A moonless night, an unlit dungeon
	





Weather
As the days pass, so too does the weather. The weather of the world can be an obstacle of its own towards wayward souls. Weather follows the rules of obstacles in that they pose difficulty towards characters and creatures in a number of ways.


Weather
	Effect
	Rain
	Hinders Wits
	Fog
	Hinders Wits
	Snow
	Hinders Wits, Endurance
	Wind
	Hinders Endurance
	Land
In the world of Mythical Monsters, there are fifteen types of terrains: Open, Canyons, Forests, Tundra, Hills, Jungles, Deserts, Oasis, Mountains, Marshes, Swamps, Rivers, Valleys, Urban, or Underground.


In each Land is a variety of obstacles that can obstruct movement, restrict vision, or even test one’s fortitude in the form of its climate.
Falling
Falling is one of the most common hazards associated with Perils. When a creature falls, the scene immediately transitions into an Engagement.


Because Falling is a result of a natural force, any movement from falling takes place during the World’s Turn upon which any falling creature moves 10 squares in the direction of gravity.


A creature can fall a number of squares equal to their own Size rating before taking damage. For each additional square of movement that a creature falls beyond their own Size rating, they will receive one point of damage upon impact.


An able creature can attempt to resist some of the fall damage by making a Finesse Test.
________________


An Average Sized (Size rating 4) creature is knocked off a ledge and begins Falling. Once the Order of Events has run its course, it becomes the World’s Turn and the creature falls 10ft/2sq.


If the creature falls 20ft, then it takes 6 Bludgeoning damage once it collides with the ground. 
________________


Hunger
Traveling on the road can result in times where one does not have the luxury of a tavern or a home cooked meal to warm them against the nightly cold. For this purpose, many adventurers and journeymen carry around rations. In Mythical Monsters, rations represent a combination of a character’s food and water supply.


Eating rations increases a character’s vigor equal to the Quality rating of the rations. Upon using rations, the quality of the rations decreases by 1. If a character goes a day without eating food or rations, then their Fatigue increases by 1 at the beginning of the next day.
Stealth
Stealth in Mythical Monsters is a game of one creature’s finesse versus another creature’s wits and awareness. Whenever a creature attempts to subtly perform an action, they must make a Finesse Test against the flat Wits rating of any nearby creatures before performing the action. If the Finesse Test is greater than the creature’s Wits ratings, then the character can make the relevant Test without arousing suspicion.


However, if the results of the Finesse Test meet or fall below the creature’s Wits rating, then they gain a level of detection. There are three levels of detection: Wary, Alert, and Searching. Wary creatures are 


Detection
	Wary
	Alert
	Alarmed
	* Stealthing creatures cannot start Engagements with a surprise
* Nearby creatures heard a sound and are now faintly suspicious.
	* Stealthing creatures cannot use their Finesse rating as Enhancement on their next action if they start an Engagement.
* Nearby creatures know someone or something is nearby. They can make a Wits Test eased by their Wits rating to discern the creature’s identity.
	* Stealth is broken
	





The Supernatural
  

The Focus Action
The focus action is used to describe the four aspects of a supernatural effect: the strength of the effect, the area being affected, how far the area is, and the duration of the effect. For the supernaturally gifted to perform wondrous feats, focus points are required. These focus points are spent towards defining a supernatural effect’s power, focus area, range, and duration. Characters with a rating in a supernatural practice gain focus points equal to their rating towards each aspect of a supernatural effect.


For example, A character with a rating of 2 in Create Fire can make a Focus Test at a rating of 2,  target an area anywhere within 60ft, target anything in a 2sq x 2sq area within that range, and make the effect last for up to two turns of an Engagement.


Power represents the potency of a supernatural effect and indicates how strong of an influence the caster wishes to exert over their targeted material form. The amount of focus points spent towards power represents an amount of dice to be rolled in the face of a present challenge.


The nature of this power and how it affects a situation is determined by the supernatural aspect being applied by the caster (Create, Alter, Sense, Manipulate, Destroy) and the material form being targeted (Magic, Fire, Water, Air, Materia, Body, Mind, Animal, Plant, Image).


Focus Area is the designated area where power is being exerted. Focus area is measured in terms of squares (sq) with each square representing enough space to encompass an average sized (size 4) creature. Each focus point spent towards an effect’s focus area increases the largest dimension (LD) the area can have by 1. For example, an area of 2 allows power to affect a 2 x 2 space or a 2 x 1 space as the largest dimension is 2 in both cases.


By default, a supernatural effect affecting the caster themselves or an adjacent square (but not both) has an area of 0. For creatures and forms to be affected, they must be at least partially contained within the effect’s area.


Range allows a caster to move an area of supernatural power away from themselves[o]. Spending focus points towards range allows a caster to move an area of power up to an additional 6 squares per point allocated. If no focus points are spent towards range, then the focus area originates from the caster’s position.


Duration lets a caster determine how long the effect is intended to last for beyond the current turn. The focus point cost depends on how long the effect is intended to persist[p]. For example, a caster who wants to create an effect lasting two Local turns would need to spend 12 focus points on duration. With the exception of Engagement turns, this cost includes the current turn.


FOCUS POINT COST
	Engagement Turn
	Local Turn
	World Turn
	0 for the current turn

1 focus point for each additional Engagement turn
	3 focus points
	12 focus points
	Focus & Vigor
Just as with aspects, a creature can spend vigor to push Focus aspects beyond what they can achieve from their base practice rating. Each additional increase to a Focus aspect not only costs a point of vigor, but each increase also increases a character’s fatigue by 1 just as with aspects.


FOCUS ASPECT
	VIGOR COST
	POWER
	-1 for each additional die. A creature can only roll an amount of dice up to the rating of their Supernatural Practice at a time.


If vigor is used to increase power, then the dice rolled will be subject to Minor or Major Blunders.
	FOCUS AREA
	0 if the effect is only self-targeted or is directed at an adjacent square.


-1 per increment to the largest dimension of the area. 
	RANGE
	0 if the effect is self-targeted or manifests in an adjacent square.


-1 to move the focus area an additional 6sq/30ft away from the caster.
	DURATION
	0 if the effect lasts only the current turn of an engagement.

-1 for each engagement turn beyond the current one.

-3 if the effect lasts for the entirety of the current Local turn and an additional -3 for each Local turn beyond the current turn.


-12 if the effect lasts for the entirety of the current World turn and an additional -12 for each World turn beyond the current turn.
	

Supernatural Aspects
Supernatural aspects describe how supernatural power allocated in the focus action or in general influences a given situation. There are five supernatural aspects: Create, Alter, Sense, Manipulate, and Destroy. Each aspect comes with a set of keywords synonymous with the aspect itself.


To use a supernatural aspect, you begin by verbalizing your intent in the form of “I want to…” followed by the aspect or one of its keywords and the associated material form. For example, using the Create aspect to summon a simple fire might be phrased as “I want to create fire.” From this statement, the Storyteller determines the challenge created from the aspect or how the aspect affects a current challenge. Using Create Fire like before would create fire pressure in an engagement or might be used to increase the pressure of an existing fire.


This process is meant to inspire imagination in the caster and to properly ascertain their intent when using magic. Each section below describes the nature of each supernatural aspect and how they interact with material forms and their properties. Some aspects will overlap and this is by design; There are multiple ways of accomplishing something through supernatural means.
Create
Keywords: Manifest, Improve, Restore


The Create aspect is a constructive force which uses magic to manifest a form from the aether into the material world. Forms spawned this way do not possess inherent motion unless they are placed in the air where gravity can affect them.


Manifest
To manifest a form, the caster must determine whether or not the form being manifested is inanimate or animate.


Power allocated towards creating inanimate forms increases the power of a form's properties by one. For example, a property of fire is that it creates fire pressure.


To create an animate form, power must be allocated towards creating aspect advancements for the animated form’s physical and mental aspects (Strength, Finesse, Endurance, Insight, Wits, Resolve). Focus area is then used to determine the form’s size rating.
	Improve
Power allocated towards improving a form allows an existing form’s aspects to be enhanced for each point of power spent. For example, a character’s Strength aspect could be enhanced in this way.
	Restore
Power allocated towards restoring a form can either improve the quality of the form or heal wounds the form has sustained.
	

Transform
Keywords: Alter, Scale, Enhance, Hinder


The Transform aspect is a transmutive force which uses magic to shift a form’s natural state from one stage to another. This aspect can only be used on forms within a supernatural effect’s focus area.


Alter
Power allocated towards altering a form allows a character to increase or decrease a property’s rating. This can be used to increase the amount of pressure a form is exerting or hinder it. Altering a form’s image does not require power but altering any of the senses it gives off does.


This can also be used to add to a natural pressure contained within the form. Water could be altered to produce acid pressure, for instance.


If a caster possesses multiple supernatural practices using Alter, they can grant a form properties naturally possessed by another. For example, fire could be given the properties of water so that it can be contained as a liquid.
	Scale
Power allocated towards changing the size of a form must first equal the form’s current size rating. Once the target number is reached, every point of power spent beyond the form’s current size can be used to increase or decrease its size rating by one rank.
	Enhance
Power allocated towards enhancing a form allows that form to receive enhancement towards  a targeted aspect equal to the power provided.
	Hinder
Power allocated towards hindering a form allows that form to receive hindrance towards a targeted aspect equal to the power provided.
	

Sense
Keywords: Sense


The Sense aspect is a divinating force which uses magic to detect a form and reveal details hidden from plain sight. The Sense aspect can only divine forms within a supernatural effect’s focus area.


Sense
Power allocated towards sensing a form begins an open test. One point of power will let the caster know whether a form exists in the focus area. Each additional point of power reveals one additional detail about the targeted forms per the Storyteller’s jurisdiction.
	

Manipulate
Keywords: Move, Shape, Influence, Ward


The Manipulate aspect is an influential force which uses magic to force a shift in the natural capabilities based on the will and intent of the caster. The Manipulate aspect can only be used on forms within a supernatural effect’s focus area.


Move
Power allocated towards moving a form allows a form to be moved enough squares equal to the power exerted. The targeted forms must be within a focus area and within range of the caster.


Moving a form up into the air causes it to immediately fall. During an engagement, this is handled during the World’s Turn. Movement does not need to be purely lateral either. A puddle of water can be made to cover a focus area centered around a puddle or the caster themselves.


Moving a form like a projectile functions as if it were being used as part of the Throw weapon action. Upon impact, the focus power allocated converts into a relevant physical pressure type enhanced by the form’s size rating. For example, throwing a stone spear with size 2 with power 4 will create a throw that yields 6 piercing physical pressure if it manages to reach a creature’s square.


Forms can also be made to move other forms like in the case of platforms or even flying carpets. The total size and weight compounded upon the form does not impact this effect so long as the caster maintains concentration.
	Shape
Shaping a form allows an area of inanimate material to be reshaped to the caster’s will. Power is not required for this but the focus area must contain the breadth of the manipulation. For example, shaping a bridge out of a cliff wall must have a focus area that reaches the other side. Shaping a form in this way does not change its natural state and persists beyond the effect’s duration.
	Influence
Power allocated towards influencing a material form affects both inanimate and animate forms in different ways.


Influence on inanimate forms allows a caster to spend power towards using the form to make an action or to enhance actions a form might make. If the form is in a different square from a caster’s target, the focus area must encapsulate both in order for the action to apply.


Influence on animate forms begins a contest where power is used to exert pressure while the targeted forms create resistance. For example, if power is used to force a targeted creature’s body to make a strike on its comrade, then the creature would be able to resist using its physical aspects. If a creature is mentally influenced into making an action against its traits or ideals, then the creature gains one die of enhancement towards resisting the effect.
	Transition
Power allocated towards transitioning a material form allows a caster to shift it from one natural state to another. Power used in this way allows a form’s age to be shifted by one step. Shifting liquid water into solid ice or mist counts as one step for this purpose. Forms transitioned in this way do not gain any pressure and so turning water into ice would not create cold pressure but it would create restraining pressure on a target.


It can also be used to accelerate actions that a material form would take normally. Power spent in this fashion represents the amount of time the form is accelerated according to the Duration focus point cost table.
	Ward
Power allocated towards wards allows a caster to generate resistance towards any actions performed by the targeted form. It would also prevent targeted forms from moving into the focus area of the effect. For example, a ward against animals would provide additional resistance against any weapon actions made.
	

Destroy
Keywords: Damage, Decay, Diminish, Hinder


The Destroy aspect is a deconstructive force which uses magic to deconstruct a form or a form’s inherent properties. The Destroy aspect can only be used on forms within a supernatural effect’s focus area.


Damage
Power allocated towards damaging a material form allows a caster to inflict wounds towards an animate form. The damage inflicted is equal to the power exerted but can be resisted by an animate creature’s Endurance rating. Damage inflicted is permanent and persists beyond the effect’s duration unless restored or healed.
	Decay
Power allocated towards decaying a material form allows a caster to decrease an object’s quality rating by an amount equal to the power provided. If the object’s quality rating reaches zero, then it is destroyed.
	Diminish
Rather than purely destroying a form, power can also be used to diminish a form’s natural properties. Rather than destroying a fire, its radiance could be diminished instead to prevent notice. Power used in this fashion hinders the relative quality of the property equal to the amount of power applied.
	Hinder
Power allocated towards hindering a form allows a form’s targeted aspect to be hindered equal to the power exerted. This only affects aspects used to make actions, not inherent aspects like size.
	

Material Forms
A material form is an aspect of reality that can be changed or influenced by supernatural forces. Within the game of Mythical Monsters, there are ten distinct material forms that can be affected by supernatural power. 


Every material form has a natural state which is composed of the natural properties it possesses in the material world. For example, the natural state of water can range from mist to liquid to ice. Water can also boil or freeze and going from one stage to the other is a natural step. Natural changes to a material form’s state will persist beyond the set duration. This includes any damage a form has sustained, any restoration provided, or expected shifts in state. The only way a supernatural effect can remain permanent is by crafting an enchantment. To learn more, go to the Enchanting section under Downtime for more details.


Each material form has a number of natural properties: pressures, resistances, and attributes. Pressures are the forces a material form can naturally exert while resistances are the forces a form naturally resists. Attributes are natural aspects of the form that can be manipulated or have a direct influence over gameplay. The attributes ‘sense’ and ‘image’ for example represent how the form is perceived by the senses.


Magic
The material form of magic is essence itself. In its purest form, it resembles a pale silvery light and provides a soft radiance. It is only capable of producing force and being a fundamental pillar of supernatural effects.

Combining Multiple Forms and Aspects
Supernatural Aspects and the Forms they affect can be combined into new effects as long as the creature or character’s wielding them have the aptitude to do so.


For example, in order to create a cloud of scalding Steam, a character must have a rating in Create Water and Create Fire. Similarly, in order to turn a Person into an Animal, a character must have ratings in both Alter Body and Alter Animal. 


The Supernatural Aspect must be the same in order for a character to take characteristics and Traits of one Form and apply them to another.


As a part of a character’s Turn, a character can also utilize multiple combinations of Supernatural Aspects sequentially. In one Focus Action, a character can use Compel Water to form a spear of ice from a nearby puddle and then use Move Water to hurl the ice spear at a target provided the character has enough Focus to spend.
Using Magic
Wielding the powers of the supernatural in the game of Mythical Monsters takes the form of a conversation with the Storyteller. Throughout the game, the Storyteller will place situations, encounters, and obstacles before the players and the players choose how their characters interact.


When using supernatural power to respond to a situation, the player describes how they use the magic available to them to respond. If the player’s idea falls within the scope of the applied Aspect, then the Storyteller then determines the main factor or factors that could cause difficulty for the character. The player then spends Vigor to build Focus and rolls a number of dice equal to the Focus Power in order to manage the effect.


An Example
________________


Storyteller: “You all proceed through the dark and ancient ruins before finally coming upon a great chasm that splits the room before you apart. It stretches 20ft wide and descends down far enough that light does not reach the bottom”


Player: “I have the supernatural practice of Create Materia. I want to create a stone bridge that spans the chasm so that we can cross”


Storyteller: “The gap is 20ft/4 squares long which requires a focus area of 4. Nothing acts as resistance to this so power isn’t required. You will need to give it a Duration so everyone can cross so that will cost you an additional Focus Point for a total of 5”


Player: “Then my character uses the Focus action and I spend 4 points of vigor towards the Focus Area and Duration while using my rating of 1 in Create Materia as Ease”


Storyteller: “Then you successfully make a stone bridge that allows both you and the party to cross!”
________________


Spirits
A spirit is a presence in the material world with no Physical Aspects. This means that on their own, a spirit cannot physically interact with the world unless they possess a physical creature or object.


Inanimate objects can be possessed without much difficulty. When a spirit possesses an inanimate object, they gain the ability to move about and control the object as an extension of themselves.


Animate or living creatures require the spirit to issue a Resolve Contest against its target. If the spirit is successful in overwhelming the target creature, it gains access to its Physical Aspects for the Turn.


The spirit can repeat this contest once per Turn until it is either convinced otherwise or is expelled from the material world.
Curses
A curse is a supernatural effect that has a long or even permanent duration. Often curses and hexes are the result of powerful beings casting malevolent magics upon the material world. Curses come in a large variety but each one has five properties: its Origin, its Nature, its Strength, its Interval, and its Cure.


The Origin of a curse is the active entity maintaining the curse. If the origin of a curse is defeated or killed, then the curse is lifted from other afflicted creatures. This can prove difficult though if the curse comes from the powers of greater beings and entities.


The Nature of a curse determines the Supernatural Effect caused by the curse. Here Supernatural Aspects define what the curse does and the linked Material Forms determine what is being affected.

The Strength of the curse determines the challenge rating imposed by the curse or the level of force generated by the curse when the next Interval occurs.


The Interval determines when the curse will happen. Lycanthropy, for example, can be taken as a form of curse where the Interval is every full moon. Intervals can occur once per day, once per month, or occur under any specific circumstances.


The Cure of a curse specifies a course of action that needs to occur in order for a cursed creature to either lift the curse or bypass the Interval. Some curses may not have a cure at all and may require a specialist to remove it.
Removing Curses
Curses can be removed under certain circumstances. If the Origin of the curse can be found and destroyed or convinced to lift the curse, then the curse will end.


Otherwise, a specialist will be needed. A curse at its core is a supernatural effect meaning that Supernatural Aspects can be used against it to destroy or alter it in some fashion. The Supernatural Practice of 'Magic Destruction' is a good example of an ability that would be able to affect a curse.


Once this condition has been met, the creature or character in question needs to generate enough Focus Power to overcome the Strength of the curse. Once this occurs, the curse is broken from all creatures in the targeted Focus Area.
Conditions
Conditions are states of being that affect a character’s ability to use their Physical and Mental Aspects as well as their Recovery. Conditions are ranked on a scale from 1 to 6 with 6 being the maximum rank any Condition can have.
Physical Conditions
Physical conditions are status conditions that are inflicted by a physical source. A character can  recover from one physical condition by making an Endurance Test during Recovery.
Staggered
A creature that is staggered walks unsteadily or has lost balance. A fully staggered creature can be considered prone or unable to maintain their composure.
* Staggered creatures have their Physical Aspects hindered equal to the rank of this condition.
* The creature is unable to perform Actions that require at least two hands.
Stunned
* Stunned creatures have their Physical Aspects and Mental Aspects hindered equal to the rank of this condition.
* If a creature reaches the maximum rank of the Stunned condition, they gain the Unconscious condition.
Restrained
* Restrained creatures have their Physical Aspects hindered equal to the rank of this condition.
* If a creature is actively restraining another, then both creatures occupy the same square until the condition is broken.
* The creature is unable to perform any Move Actions.
Blinded
* All Actions that require sight are hindered equal to the rank of this condition
Deafened
* All Actions that require hearing are hindered equal to the rank of this condition
Silenced
* All Actions that require the ability to speak are hindered equal to the rank of this condition
Poisoned
* All Actions that require hearing are hindered equal to the rank of this condition
Diseased
* All Actions that require hearing are hindered equal to the rank of this condition


Mental Conditions
Mental conditions are status conditions that are inflicted by an emotive source. A character can  recover from one mental condition by making a Resolve Test during Recovery.
Troubled
* All Actions are hindered equal to the rank of this condition.
Distracted
* All Actions are hindered equal to the rank of this condition.
Frightened
* All Actions made against the source of fear are hindered equal to the rank of this condition. A character cannot move any closer to the source of the fear either.
Charmed
* All Actions that act contrary to the nature of the charm are hindered equal to the rank of this condition.
Confused
* All Actions are hindered equal to the rank of this condition.


Natural Conditions
Natural conditions are conditions that can only be caused by natural pressure. For instance, the burning condition is gained when a character receives fire pressure.
Burning
* A creature that is wearing an Armor Set with zero Fire Resistance gains the Burning condition with a rank equal to the Fire Pressure they receive.
* On the World’s Turn, a creature receives Wounds equal to the rank of this condition and then this condition’s rank increases by one.
* The Quality rating of a creature’s Armor Set and Apparel decreases by one for each Round this condition is held.
Freezing
* A creature that is wearing an Armor Set with zero Cold Resistance gains the Freezing condition with a rank equal to the Cold Pressure they receive.
* On the World’s Turn, a creature loses vigor equal to the rank of this condition. If a creature’s vigor is reduced to zero, then the creature receives Wounds equal to the rank of this condition instead.
* Freezing creatures have their Physical Aspects hindered equal to the rank of this condition.
Suffocating
* A creature that is unable to breathe gains the Suffocating condition.
* On the World’s Turn, a creature loses vigor equal to the rank of this condition. If a creature’s vigor is reduced to zero, then the creature receives Wounds equal to the rank of this condition instead.
Petrifying
* Petrifying creatures have their Physical Aspects hindered equal to the rank of this condition.
* On the World’s Turn, a creature loses vigor equal to the rank of this condition. If a creature’s vigor is reduced to zero, then the creature receives Wounds equal to the rank of this condition instead.
Unconscious
An unconscious creature cannot perform Actions or provide any form of active resistance. If the creature is sleeping, then they must be roused awake by another creature or sufficiently loud noise. A creature that is unconscious and bloodied must make an Endurance Check or a Resolve Check during Recovery to be conscious in the following turn.
Death’s Door
When a creature’s Wounds rating equals or exceeds their Death’s Door rating, they are on Death’s Door. Any further damage taken by the creature subtracts from their vigor rather than add to their Wounds.


If a creature is on Death’s Door by the time the World Turns, then the creature must make a Recovery Test and meet or exceed their Wounds rating. If they fail, then they gain one rank of the Unconscious condition. However, if the Recovery Test succeeds, then they either remove an existing rank from their Unconscious condition or remain active in the following turn.
________________


A character with Wounds rating 5 and a Death’s Door of 3 is on Death’s Door. When the World Turns, the character will lose 2 vigor and reduce their Wounds rating to match their Death’s Door rating. Additionally, they will need to roll a number of dice equal to their Recovery rating and earn enough successes to meet or beat their Wounds rating or take one rank of the Unconscious condition upon entering the following turn.
________________




Death
Three things must happen in order for a creature to die:
* The creature must be on Death’s Door.
* The creature must have zero vigor.
* The creature must have at least one rank of the Unconscious condition.


Once all three conditions have been fulfilled by the time the World Turns, then the creature effectively dies.
Maladies
Maladies are physical phenomena like poisons and diseases that inflict ailments upon their victims. Maladies have five properties: Forms of Contact, Strength, Test Interval, Side Effects, and Cures.
Forms of Contact
The Forms of Contact comprise how the malady is acquired. There are four common kinds of contact for maladies: Touch, Ingestion, Inhalation, and Wounds. It is possible for a malady to have multiple Application Methods.


Touch: Poisons that use this method need to be touched in order to activate.


Ingested: Ingested poisons need to be consumed in order to deal their effects to the victim.


Inhalation: Inhaled poisons take the form of gaseous clouds or powders that can be inhaled. Unless a creature is wearing a suitable face covering, they are subject to the effects of the poison as long as they are within the same square as the cloud.


Wounds: Poisons with this application method can only be effective when they are a part of an action that inflicts wounds on a creature.
Strength
When a creature has been afflicted with a Malady, the affliction doesn't take effect until the end of the current Turn. If the Test Interval of a Malady happens at a more immediate stage of play, then the scene immediately shifts to that stage.


At the end of the Turn, the afflicted creature must make an Endurance Test against the indicated Strength of the Malady. Upon success, the creature is fine and the Strength of the Malady is reduced by 1. When the Strength of the Malady has been reduced to zero, the Malady is overcome.


On a failure, the afflicted character suffers the Side Effects of the Malady equal to the margin of failure and gains any symptoms associated with it.


________________


For example, if a character ate food poisoned with one dose of Wolfsbane, then the scene would shift to the Engagement stage. At the end of the Turn, the poisoned character would need to make an Endurance Test.


In this example, the character has an Endurance rating of 2. They roll their 2 dice and gain 1 success against 3 which is the Strength CR of Wolfsbane. In this case, the margin of failure is 2 and the character takes 2 damage and gains 2 ranks of Suffocation as per the Side Effects of Wolfsbane.
________________




This continues until the character has either overcome the Strength of the Malady through repeated Tests, the character receives a Cure to the current Malady, or until the character dies.


If a character takes multiple doses of a Malady, then the Strength of the Malady is increased per dose. If a character takes two doses of Nightshade, for example, the Strength of the Malady would become 2 instead of 1 for both doses.

[a]Since this will be published digitally, we can improve navigation of the document by providing hyperlinks.


BUT since this will be all part of the same document at some point, we may want to include a page number as well.
[b]One reason why having a style guide will be important is that digits can be either written out or represented by a symbol. We'll need to decide how we want the language of the document to reflect that. I think you've done a good job differentiating the opposing contexts here.


So going forward, the rule we would want to follow would be, the number of dice you roll is spelled out, but successes are represented by symbols.
[c]Whats a push?
[d]It's a game term to describe rolling an additional die whenever a die lands on a 6.
[e]Note to self to discuss tense and point-of-view with Kasper at some point. I'm tempted to take a look at how often the 5e player's guide uses "you" as well.
[f]How does one gain fatigue
[g]This is mentioned in the vigor section which is further up
[h]How many actions per turn do you get?
[i]As many as one can make
[j]Should think about a way to include fatigue higher or to cite this when you introduce Fatigue above
[k]Fatigue is mentioned in vigor which is the main source of how one accrues it
[l]add "or Exploration" during explorations (If I am assuming this right). Otherwise, add "or Exploration" to the world turn
[m]One document of this story that includes all of the features would be amazing and I think you should consider it as like a "starters template story" when first playing the game"
[n]It's fine to call this section "The Marketplace" but maybe we can prescribe these rules to a turn or stage, like Downtime, such as Bartering or Shopping, and so on.
