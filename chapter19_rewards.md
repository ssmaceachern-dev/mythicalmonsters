# Rewarding the Players
There is a simple principle of game design which is unilateral across all games: the behavior a game *rewards* is the behavior a game *encourages*. This section is going to pull back the curtain a bit and reveal how the sausage is made. Suffice to say, most players play a fantasy tabletop to gain some kind of reward. This may come in the form of a heart-felt moment between two characters or it may even take the shape of a large sack of money.

In Mythmaker, the main motivation is finding opportunities to use vigor and grow the character sheet. By the time a character is hitting their first level of mastery, they will be a wealth of knowledge and experience... and probably also rich if they play their cards right.

## Reward Cards
Reward Cards are a way of giving your players specific rewards for exploring adventure hooks. The structure of a reward card is pretty straightforward. On one side of the card is the goal to be accomplished either during the adventure or during downtime. And on the other is the reward for completing that goal.

>**Goal:** Defeat the Duke of Amaro
>
>**Reward:** Gain the Sword of Tahall
>

There are two ways of presenting a Reward Card to the player: Either reveal the card outright or provide Clues indicating what the reward is. With the first option, you create an opportunity for the player to pursue the goal within the confines of the adventure or beyond its scope. Providing the knowledge ahead of time gives the player agency in deciding how their character responds to the events happening around them. The latter option weaves better into narratives and may be preferred if that's the tone of game you are looking to inspire at the table.

Be warned though to not make too many of these reward cards. If there are too many rewards or if the rewards offered by them are greater than the ones offered by the original adventure, then the players will be motivated to pursue these side ventures instead of attacking the main obstacles.

### Forms of Reward
Mythmaker offers a number of options to use when determining what kind of reward or rewards to affix to a reward card.

#### **Wealth**
Monetary reward is the most basic form of reward. Wealth within Mythmaker grants access to higher quality items in the marketplace and can serve as a means of obtaining property as grand as a castle.

Wealth can be earned in the form of marks or even by stating the level of Wealth a given adventure will bring the characters.

>An adventure with a reward of Wealth 4 means that any character with a Wealth rating below 4 immediately ascends to Wealth 4. If a character is already at Wealth 4, then they can make a Market Value Test as if they were selling to the marketplace to earn marks towards their Wealth rating.

If your world has multiple currencies, then being awarded a given Wealth rating as long as they trade within another nation may also be a feasible option.

#### **Downtime**
Rewarding the players with a specific amount of Downtime actions at the end of an adventure is quite valuable as well. Downtime actions allow a character to pursue their own individual interests between adventures, letting them expand and grow their character how they see fit.

Downtime actions also grant characters opportunities to rest and recuperate from acquired Traumas after a particularly harrowing adventure. For you, this acts as an opportunity to provide additional hooks for characters to explore for their next adventure and also reveal key supporting characters who play an important part in the campaign at large.

#### **Psychological**
For players who enjoy role-playing, having an opportunity to act and emote towards an important figure from their backstory can serve as a reward in and of itself. A character who has had a troubled past with their father may find solice when they return and show him the emblems of their heroism.

Similarly, if a character's family was killed or affected by a villain's subordinate, the player would find a psychological reward in seeing to delivering justice towards the adversary. Providing this level of reward can be tricky but if done well and respectfully, can elevate the game emotionally.

#### **Titular**
Titles are another effective way of rewarding the players, especially if those titles come with associated mechanical benefits. For instance, helping a village with their recent encounter with a mythical creature may grant the players the title: "Heroes of the Town" where the Market Value of any item they wish to purchase is reduced by 1.

Or perhaps helping an enclave of trolls grants the players the title of "Troll Friends" where any Resolve Test made to convince a troll to help them is Eased by 1.

These titles can also work as marks of their allegiance towards a given cause and a show of their growing fame within the region. Being a friend of the trolls might unintentionally place them at odds with elflings who have been battling the trolls for years.

#### **Physical Rewards**
Like Wealth, physical rewards can also incentivize the players into accepting an adventure hook. Perhaps saving the local art gallery from a fire grants the characters a custom portrait from a highly esteemed artist. Or for something more practical, they may be given a high quality item from a vendor who they have helped during the course of the adventure.

Use the items in the marketplace to serve as possible examples for items to present to the players. Plus players hate losing things that they've earned meaning the theft of an item or even a horse for that matter may serve as an effective hook for the next adventure.

#### **Supernatural Items**
In a world of fantasy, the players will undoubtedly come across supernatural items to covet and amuse over. Supernatural items, in essence, are ordinary items with an enchantment upon them that grants access to either one or several supernatural practices.

>**Item**: Magic Iron Longsword
>
>**Size** 2 -- **Quality** 2
>
>**Weapon Actions**: SP
>
>**Enchantment**: Create Fire **P** 1 **A** 1 **R** 0 **D** 0 -- **Quality** 3

Enchantments on an item allow a character to make use of the supernatural ability as if they had the power to wield it. The quality rating of an enchantment represents the number of times they can make use of this ability before the resource is depleted. Bearing an enchantment, however, will increase an item's natural rarity by the quality rating of the enchantment itself.

Finding a magical item should be a special reward in an of itself. Within a world of fantasy, the quintessential magic item represents an element of the unknown. It is a piece of mystical technology that paints a picture of the larger world and, in a sense, gives a sense of the world's own character. That's why you as the Worldbuilder and Storyteller should feel compelled to go beyond the rules of this game to add your own flare to your magic items. Let your imagination flow!

>**Item**: Enchanted Music Box
>
>**Size** 0 -- **Quality** 3
>
>**Enchantment**: Create Mind **P** 4 **A** 4 **R** 0 **D** 0 -- **Quality** 4
>
>**Details**: This music box contains floral patterns and stems engraved upon its woodwork. When it opens, it plays an emotional dirge that causes those who hear the tune to become overwhelmed with sadness.

Imagine finding a candle down there in the dark ruins of a forgotten kingdom. Unlike other candles, this one does not dwindle and its flame casts a solemn blue light when lit. Now imagine the players' reactions when the candle lights itself when they enter a location in another part of the world.

Or perhaps the players find a sword with notches in the blade that when swung produce a musical rhythm. Maybe a random scroll they possess reveals areas around them as if it were a map making itself. The flexibility of the magic system is designed to mechanically allow whatever effects you think are cool.
