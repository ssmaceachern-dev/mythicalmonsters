# The First Steps of Adventure
When you think of an adventurer, who do you imagine? It's difficult to nail down a precise definition other than someone who goes on adventures. But *who* goes on adventures?

Rich nobles, blessed clergymen, and master guildsmen have no need for adventure as what they're often satisfied with their station in life. No, adventurers seek what is beyond their grasp. A humble home in the hills. A family to share one's comforts. Wealth to surpass kings and queens. Master of both the body and the mind. You have none of these else why would you be an adventurer?

But you've got that spark in you. There's a part of you that yearns for what lies beyond these foothills. To discover what fathomless yet wondrous riches lie in a land where giants wander.

This section will guide you through the steps needed to form a character from the aether capable of adventuring in a world of Mythical Monsters.

## The Recipe of a Legend
The creation of a given character for the Mythical Monsters Roleplaying Game follows the following steps. Each step will provide the default options available to you and walk you through what to add to your character sheet.

1. Receive Starting Experience
2. Determine Ancestry
3. Determine Natures
4. Advance Aspects
5. Advance Professions
6. Advance Knowledge
7. Advance Practices
8. Choose Equipment from the Marketplace
9. Determine Allies
10. Determine a Name and Details

To further illustrate the character creation, we will be creating a character alongside you named Ingram Wolfsbane.

## Receive Starting Experience
A character begins with a determined tier of starting experience which grants specific boons at the beginning of an adventure or campaign. This is the one aspect of the character determined by the Storyteller. These boons take the form of *advancements*. Advancements are used to increase the rating of a given aspect, knowledge, profession, or practice by 1. Increasing an aspect’s rating from 1 to 2 costs 1 aspect advancement as would increasing an aspect’s rating from 2 to 3.

There are four tiers of starting experience: **Novice**, **Apprentice**, **Journeyman**, and **Master**. Each tier comes with it a given amount of Advancements and a starting Wealth rating.

| Starting Experience | Aspect Advancements | Profession Advancements | Knowledge Advancements | Practice Advancements | Starting Wealth |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Novice              | 1                   | 1                       | 1                      | 1                     | 2               |
| Apprentice          | 2                   | 2                       | 2                      | 2                     | 3               |
| Journeyman          | 3                   | 3                       | 3                      | 3                     | 4               |
| Master              | 4                   | 4                       | 4                      | 4                     | 5               |

    Everyone has sat down at the table to begin creating their characters. The Storyteller declares that everyone will be starting the adventure at the Novice tier.

## Determine Ancestry
The next step of the character creation process is determining the ancestry of the character. For this step, have a look at the default Ancestries and choose one that appeals to you. 

Each Ancestry will have two options for a **Natural Aspect Advancement** specific to that species. Simply choose one for your character to inherit and advance the rating of the chosen Aspect by 1.

Next, record the size and size rating of the ancestry. When adding senses to the sheet, some ancestries will either have options for a given sense or have an extra sense to add. You can review the senses in the section after Ancestries.

    Ingram Wolfsbane is a proud dwarf. Faced with the choice between Endurance or Resolve as their natural aspect advancement, lets go with Endurance to make them extra hardy. We'll find the Endurance aspect on the character sheet and increase it from its starting rating of 1 to 2. 
    
    Next, we'll enter Average under the Size section and 4 under the Size Rating section. Under Sense Rating, we'll put 3. Now as we get to the Senses themselves, we have another choice: We can either give this dwarf Common Sight or Dark Sight. We'll choose Common Sight for now and add Common Hearing.

## Determine Natures
A character is so much more than words or numbers on a page. They are a vision; an ideal in your mind with characteristics and flaws. In Mythical Monsters, these qualities take the form of three natures: *traits*, *virtues*, and *troubles*. Regardless of a character's starting experience, a character begins play with two traits, two virtues, and two troubles.

| Traits | Virtues | Troubles |
| ------ | ------- | -------- |
| 2      | 2       | 2        |

### Traits
Traits take the form of a word or a phrase used to describe a character's affinity with a given aspect. One example of an edge might be the word 'Strong' which could be used to describe a character's pure brawn. On the other hand, 'Strong of Heart' could also refer to a character's steely resolve in the face of adversity. Traits can be used to enhance any core aspect of a character: Strength, Finesse, Endurance, Sense, Insight, Wits, and Resolve.

| Example Trait   | Enhanced Aspect |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Strong          | Strength        |
| Strong of Heart | Resolve         |
| Quick Thinker   | Wits            |
| Studious        | Insight         |
| Hardy           | Endurance       |
| Agile           | Finesse         |
| Alert           | Sense           |

When a character invokes a trait, they gain one extra die of enhancement whenever a situation incorporates or tests that trait. However the Test must somehow incorporate that trait. Being physically strong has little influence in a game of wits, after all.

    Ingram Wolfsbane's traits are Strong (Strength) and Courageous (Resolve). Ingram's Strong trait can be invoked whenever a Test involves a feat of strength. Her Courageous trait in turn can be invoked whenever a Test involves a feat of resolve against fear.   

### Virtues
A character's virtues form the guiding stars of their journey. They are themes, concepts, or philosophies they choose to embody which can both help or test their resolve. Like Traits, Virtues are represented by a word or phrase which can be invoked to provide one die of Enhancement towards a given Test. However, Virtues can only enhance Tests that invoke a character's Resolve.

Virtues can also test a character's resolve should they pursue an action that goes against it. Whenever a character is about to act against a virtue, they must succeed on a Resolve Check to continue taking said action. If they fail, then they are given a choice: either they must forego the action entirely or take one additional rank of the Troubled condition in order to carry the action through.

One way to come up with a virtue is to find words that can be placed at the end of phrases like "I believe in...", "I want...", "I will protect...", or "I am a champion of..."

| Example Phrase        | Virtue                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| I want...             | Wealth                              |
| I believe in...       | Helping the Poor                    |
| I am a champion of... | People who cannot defend themselves |
| I will protect...     | My family                           |

    Ingram Wolfsbane values courage and defending the weak. Therefore under the Virtues section of their character sheet, Ingram will have:
    - I believe in... being courageous
    - I am a champion... of the weak


### Troubles
While heroes are alleged to be paragons of perfection and defining beacons of heroism, the reality is that everyone has something that troubles them. Troubles and Ideals are two sides of the same coin in that they both test a character's Resolve. However Troubles take the form of a word or object and can potentially act as hindrance to the actions of a character.

When a character is confronted by one of their Troubles, they must make a Resolve Check. If they succeed, they are able to make a Test with no additional hindrance. However, upon failure, they gain one rank of the Troubled condition.

A good way to come up with a trouble is to find words or things that can be placed at the end of phrases like "I hate...", "I'm frustrated by...", "I fear...", or "I cannot..."

| Example Phrase       | Trouble        |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| I hate...            | Spiders        |
| I'm frustrated by... | Puzzles        |
| I fear...            | Dragons        |
| I cannot...          | Trust Nobles   |
| I'm frustrated by    | Crowded Places |
| I fear...            | Fungus         |
| I cannot resist...   | Gourmet Food   |

    Ingram Wolfsbane has trouble with gambling and spiders. Under the Troubles section of their character sheet, Ingram will have:
    - I cannot resist... gambling
    - I fear... spiders

## Advance Aspects
An aspect is a representation of a creature’s capabilities. There are eight aspects for a given character in Mythical Monsters: Strength, Finesse, Endurance, Insight, Wits, Resolve, Sense, and Wealth. Each aspect forms the base of a Test in order to overcome a challenge.

**When you have reached this step**, locate the row in the table below that corresponds to your character's starting experience. The number under Aspect Advancements represents the number of advancements you can make on any Aspect.

| Starting Experience | Aspect Advancements | Starting Wealth |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Novice              | 1                   | 2               |
| Apprentice          | 2                   | 3               |
| Journeyman          | 3                   | 4               |
| Master              | 4                   | 5               |

    Ingram Wolfsbane is starting out as a Novice and begins with 1 Aspect Advancement. They've already gained a natural aspect advancement in Endurance from being a dwarf so we'll advance their Strength instead. With this advancement, we'll increase Ingram's Strength rating from 1 to 2.

## Advance Professions
Professions represent your character’s backgrounds and areas of expertise in a given trade before delving into the world of Mythical Monsters. 

A given rating in a Profession represents an amount of Enhancement that can be added to Insight Tests that relate to a given skill set. It also allows characters to make items or perform services associated with that Profession by making a Profession Test.

**When you have reached this step**, locate the row in the table below that corresponds to your character's starting experience. The number under Profession Advancements represents the number of advancements you can make towards a Profession. All professions start with no rating and require at least one advancement in order for the character to be able to use the experience to their advantage.

| Starting Experience | Profession Advancements |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Novice              | 1                       |
| Apprentice          | 2                       |
| Journeyman          | 3                       |
| Master              | 4                       |

There are fourteen trades that a character can find a Profession in upon making their character:
**Agriculture,   Art,    Crafts,    Criminal,    Entertainment,    Government,    Medicine,   Merchant, Military,    Religion,    Sailor,    Scholarship,    Service,    Vagabond**

Spend an advancement by picking a Trade that interests you and go to the Professions section of the character sheet. Under Trade, enter the Trade you've selected and then set the rating equal to the number of advancements you're spending on it. If you have more than once advancement available to you, you can choose to spread them across an additional number of Trades.

    Now it's time to choose a Profession for Ingram Wolfsbane. From the Novice tier, we get 1 Profession Advancement. Lets make Ingram a mercenary. Under their Trade we'll put Military and under Profession we'll put Mercenary. Then we'll increase the Profession's rating from 0 to 1.

\*For the Merchant Profession, you must pick an item or trade that the Marketplace sells e.g. Spice Merchant or Weapons Merchant. 


## Advance Knowledge
Characters will also possess familiarity in certain areas of knowledge beyond their normal profession. A rating in a given knowledge acts as Enhancement whenever a character makes an Insight Test that uses that knowledge with some exceptions. In Mythical Monsters, there are two kinds of knowledge: *Common*, *Esoteric*, and *Linguistic*.

Common Knowledge is knowledge that most people will have some familiarity with and is divided into four main areas: **Local**, **Occult**, **Nature**, and **Lore**. 

Esoteric Knowledge is specific knowledge that only a significantly smaller group of people know such as a knowledge of frogs or a dead language.

Linguistics comprises the knowledge of languages beyond the common language shared throughout the connected parts of the fantasy world. Mythical Monsters offers the following default languages beyond common: **fae**, **dragon**, **dwarvish**, **goblin**, and **bestial**. Any additions or modifications to this list are subject to the Storyteller. Unlike Common or Esoteric knowledges, a rating in a language acts as Ease instead of Enhancement towards Tests against challenges based on understanding the contextual use of a given language.

**When you've reached this step**, locate the row in the table below that corresponds to your character's starting experience. The number under Knowledge Advancements represents the number of advancements you can make towards either a Common, Esoteric, or Linguistic Knowledge. All forms of knowledge start with no rating and require at least one advancement in order for the character to be able to use the knowledge towards Tests.

| Starting Experience | Knowledge Advancements |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Novice              | 1                      |
| Apprentice          | 2                      |
| Journeyman          | 3                      |
| Master              | 4                      |

Locate the Knowledge section on your character sheet and decide which areas of Knowledge you would like to advance. If you choose to put an advancement towards an Esoteric knowledge, fill the portion left of the rating with a specific knowledge of your choosing and increase its adjacent rating by 1. For advancements spent towards Linguistic knowledge, choose one of the default languages above or from the set provided by your Storyteller and write it in under the Languages section of the sheet and increase its rating by 1.

    After reviewing the options for Knowledge, Lore might be a fitting choice for our would-be adventurer as a beginning knowledge. So we find the Common Knowledge section of the character sheet and increase the rating of Lore by 1.

## Advance Practices
A practice in Mythical Monsters represents a specialized form of training or supernatural ability that a character can use to their advantage. There are two forms a practice can take: Martial or Supernatural.

**When you've reached this step**, locate the row in the table below that corresponds to your character's starting experience. The number under Practice Advancements represents the number of advancements you can make towards either a Martial or Supernatural Practice. All practices start with no rating and require at least one advancement in order for the character to be able to use the knowledge towards Tests.

You should review the Martial Practice and Supernatural Practice Sections for how to fill the Practices section of your character sheet.

| Starting Experience | Practice Advancements |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Novice              | 1                     |
| Apprentice          | 2                     |
| Journeyman          | 3                     |
| Master              | 4                     |

### **Martial Practices**
A martial practice indicates that your character has spent some time learning how to fight. Whether it was from an esteemed fencing master or the school of hard knocks, your character bears additional training.

**When spending a Practice Advancement towards obtaining a rank in a Martial Practice**, find an available martial practices from the table below that interests you and add the name of it where it says Practice. Some Martial Practices offer specializations as well. For these, simply pick the one you wish to invest in and write it in the adjacent Specialization field.

Under Class, write Martial and then increase its rating from 0 to 1. Martial Practices do not use Resources do you can leave that blank.

| Martial Practice        | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Specializations                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Martial Training        | Gain Enhancement equal to the rating of this Practice whenever a character makes a Weapon Action matching their Specialization                                | Pierce, Slash, Bludgeon, Aim,  Throw                                                      |
| Stealth Training        | Gain Enhancement equal to the rating of this Practice whenever Finesse is used towards Stealth                                                                | --                                                                                        |
| Weapons Training        | Gain Enhancement equal to the rating of this Practice whenever a Weapon action is made using a specific Weapon subclass                                       | Light, Versatile, Heavy, Ranged, Shields                                                  |

    Ingram Wolfsbane has had some training what with being a mercenary and all. So under the Practices section, lets give them some Martial Training. Lets choose Slash as a specialization and use the advancement to give it a rating of 1.

### **Supernatural Practices**
Within the world of Mythical Monsters, there are those who are capable of performing wondrous feats. Those who can manifest their will upon the mundane world do so through their supernatural practice. A supernatural practice has two components: an intent and a form. An intent is a special verb that describes how a given supernatural power is being used and the form describes what that power is affecting. Together, they create a phrase indicating what someone can do with their supernatural powers.

| Intent | Form | Supernatural Practice |
| ------ | ---- | --------------------- |
| Create | Fire | Create Fire           |

**When spending a Practice Advancement towards obtaining a rank in a Supernatural Practice**, you will need to establish the actual practice you are investing it in as well as the *class* it falls under.

The table below summarizes the five intents available to you. Supernatural power is explained in further detail in the Supernatural section.

#### **Supernatural Specializations**
Within the game of Mythical Monsters, there are three specializations of supernatural power: Magical, Devotional, and Mystical. Each class has a Class Boon which is unique to that class of power.
___
**MAGICAL**

Characters who can use a magical practice derive their powers from practice and knowledge of the arcane arts. Often this is obtained through tutelage but it is possible to gain this power from one's own self-discovery.

| **Class Boon**  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Versatility** | A character that has aptitude in one magically-based practice is  capable of picking up another. In order for magic-based characters to learn other practices in their class, they must seek out other practitioners or obtain pieces of lore providing guidance towards the powers they seek. |

**When choosing to play a magical character**, write down Magical under Class in the Practice section of the character sheet.
___
**DEVOTIONAL**

Characters who can use a devotional practice derive their powers from a patron not of the mundane world. In forming a pact with this patron, a character becomes an agent of the patron's will as well as their teachings.

| **Class Boon**       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resource** (Favor) | A character that has sworn devotion to a patron's cause gains access to the resource Favor. Favor is a resource that can be used to power supernatural effects instead of vigor as a character spends time following their patron's virtues. Favor is not interchangeable between multiple patrons. |

**When choosing to play a devotional character**, write down Devotional under Class in the Practice section of the character sheet. Then set the value under Resources to be double the starting rating of the devotional practice.
___
**MYSTICAL**

Characters with access to a mystical practice are tried to a bastion of power located somewhere in the mundane world. This bastion can take the form of a creature, location, bloodline, or even an object of some kind. Mystical characters attune to these sources and in exchange gain access to a curio, an item or familiar representing this supernatural bond.

| **Class Boon**         | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Resource** (Essence) | A character with mystical powers can store essence within their curio. This essence can be later used to power supernatural effects in place of vigor. |

**When choosing to play a mystical character**, write down Mystical under Class in the Practice section of the character sheet. Then set the value under Resources to be double the starting rating of the mystical practice.
___

    Lets pretend Ingram Wolfsbane has some kind of supernatural gift instead of martial training. Perhaps they are a chosen paladin to a dwarf deity. First we need to choose the practice associated with this divine pact. Lets go with Create Fire as our supernatural practice. Then under specialization, we write Devotional before giving the practice a rating of 1. However, Devotional practices also gain the benefit of a Resource from their boon so the value under Resource becomes 2.

## Choose Starting Equipment
Now it is time to determine the character’s starting Equipment. A new character must choose their starting **Weapons**, **Armor Set**, **Apparel**, **Starting Pack**, and **Trinket**.

When picking out a given piece of equipment or item, you'll want to take note of its *market value*. A character can only purchase an item when its market value is less than or equal to their Wealth rating. The market value of an item is determined by two factors: the general rarity of the item and its quality. An item's rarity will be listed on its respective table meaning the quality of the item will become your wealth rating minus the item's rarity.

    If you have a starting Wealth of 3 and you wish to buy an item with Rarity 2, then the maximum quality that item can be is 1.

**When you get to this section**, locate the row that corresponds to your character's starting experience to find your character's Starting Wealth. If you haven't used any aspect advancements yet, you can spend them towards improving your wealth rating. Then review each of the following sections and follow the instructions for selecting your character's starting gear.

| Starting Experience | Starting Wealth |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Novice              | 2               |
| Apprentice          | 3               |
| Journeyman          | 4               |
| Master              | 5               |

### Choosing Weapons
When choosing a character’s starting weapon, a player has the following options:
- Two light melee weapons
- One light melee weapon and one versatile weapon
- One light weapon and one shield
- One versatile weapon and one shield
- One heavy weapon
- One ranged weapon and one light weapon

**When you get to this step**, choose one of the starting sets above and then find corresponding weapons below to match the set. Then record the details into the Weapons section of your character sheet. For ranged weapons, you'll record both the ranged weapon and the ammunition.

    Ingram Wolfsbane has Martial Training in slashing weapons so we'll want to find a weapon that can perform that weapon action. A bastard sword fits this critera well enough so we'll copy the corresponding details for the sword into the Weapon's section of the character sheet. Ingram's Wealth is 2 and the rarity of the entry is 1 so the quality of the bastard sword will be 1. It's a shoddy thing to start with, but surely a fortuitous quest can pay for an upgrade.

    We also get access to a shield. With Ingram's Wealth of 2, we can only really afford the first basic wooden shield. So we'll copy the relevant details into the Shield section to finish this part off.

#### **Melee Weapons**
Light weapons are weapons that can only be wielded in one hand whereas Heavy weapons require both hands. Versatile weapons fall in the middle where less strength is required to wield them in both hands but where more strength is required to wield it in one.

The Size rating of a weapon indicates the minimum Strength aspect rating required in order to use a weapon’s size rating as Enhancement towards either Weapon actions or resisting them. A character with less strength than the required amount can still wield it but does not receive this benefit.

    A size rating such as 1/2 means that the weapon has an effective size rating of 1 when wielded in one hand and 2 when wielded in two hands.

| Type      | Material              | Weapon        | Size Rating | Rarity | S   | P   | B   |

| Heavy     | Iron, Bronze, or Wood | Great Club    | 3           | 2      |     |     | X   |

Steel can also be chosen as a material for a given weapon, but doing so increases the weapon's rarity by 3. However, any weapon actions performed with a steel weapon gains 1 Enhancement.

#### **Shields**
Shields are a hybrid between weapons and armor as they can be used for both offense and defense. To choose a shield to wield, first choose a shield material and then determine its size rating. A shield’s size rating acts Enhancement during engagements when they need to resist an incoming strike. Shields can also function as a melee weapon and get access to all of the Weapon Actions that entail so long as the shield fits the criteria for each Weapon Action.

| Material | Natural Resistances | Size Rating | Rarity | S Vuln. | P Vuln. | B Vuln. |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- |

#### **Ranged Weapons**
Ranged weapons are used to send a piece of ammunition at a target from a distance. The use of any ranged weapon requires the use of both hands.

| Material | Weapon         | Base Range   | Size Rating | Rarity | S   | P   | B   |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |

| Wood     | Hand Crossbow  | 90ft/3 Zones | 2           | 3      |     |     | X   |

By themselves, ranged weapons are little more than a bludgeoning weapon. Ammunition is what allows for striking a given creature or entity from a distance.

| Ammunition | Used By     | Size Rating | Rarity | S   | P   | B   |

### Armor Sets
Next choose an armor set for the character to begin playing in. The key elements of an armor set are its natural resistances, physical vulnerabilities, and its armor rating. Natural resistances represent the amount of natural pressure they can resist before the character takes wounds. Physical vulnerabilities tie in with the armor rating: If a character is made the target of a Weapon action and the attack type matches one of the vulnerabilities of an armor set, then the character can use the Armor rating as Enhancement when they resist. However, if the attack type does not match any vulnerabilities an armor set possesses, then the character can use the Armor rating as Ease towards resisting instead.

**When you get to this step**, peruse the available armor sets below and pick one that stands out to you. Once you've chosen an armor set, copy down the various elements into the Armor Set section of your character sheet. For the quality rating of the armor set, take your Wealth aspect and subtract the rarity of the armor set.

    Ingram Wolfsbane is a front line fighter who will probably be taking their fair share of blows when push comes to shove. With their Wealth of 2, an Iron Breastplate makes the most sense for them. So we'll find the entry for Iron Breastplate on the table below and record the entry onto the Armor Set section of the character sheet. Ingram's Wealth is 2 and the armor's rarity is 1 so the quality of the armor set will start at 1.

### Determine Apparel
Apparel describes what a given character is wearing that does not contribute towards their armor. The quality rating of this apparel becomes equal to the character's Wealth rating.

**When you get to this step**, you are at liberty to describe the items your character is wearing. Jewelry or other equippable trinkets are listed here as well.

    Ingram Wolfsbane's apparel consists of a broad sunhat, roughed up pants, and a dark tan doublet. They also wear a set of earrings on each ear.

### Determine a Starting Pack
Starting Packs are composed of goods to quickly get an adventurer on their way. In Mythical Monsters, a character's inventory consists of two parts: a pack and the held items.

Packs are containers that a character or creature can equipt in order to carry items on their journeys. As with most items, packs have a size and quality rating. However, the capacity of a pack indicates the maximum total sum of size that can fit in it. A pack cannot have a size rating greater than the creature wearing it.

Held items are just that: Items that have a size, rarity, and quality rating. However, the size of an item cannot surpass the size rating of the pack its inside.

    A standard adventuring backpack has size 3 and capacity 8. It can hold up to eight size 1 items or four size 2 items or some alternative variations. But it cannot carry an item with size 4.

**When you get to this step**, peruse the packs below and pick one that stands out to you. Once you've chosen a pack, copy the various details over to the corresponding section of your character sheet. For the quality ratings of the pack itself and the items within it, take your Wealth aspect and subtract the rarity each given item and enter the result into the adjacent quality rating field.

    Ingram Wolfsbane's journey is just beginning and so starting them off with a Journeyman's Pack will give them the basic essentials for surviving the world of Mythical Monsters. We'll record all of the various values for a Journeyman's Pack into the corresponding Pack section of our character sheet along with the Inventory section below it.

### Choose a Trinket
Now it’s time to choose a Trinket. Trinkets are small items of an inconsequential size that add a touch of flavor to the character. Perhaps they acquired the Trinket from a mysterious origin or maybe it was handed down to them by a family member. 

**When you get to this step**, you can either pick a Trinket that appeals to you from the list, use a random number generator to pick a number between 1 to 100, or approach the Storyteller with an idea for a Trinket of your very own.

    For Ingram, we’ll say they received Trinket #24 as their intriguing item, a medal known to be awarded to heroes of a long forgotten kingdom. Maybe it was handed down to them by a beloved grandparent or they happened upon it while they were serving in the Military.

| #   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 2   | An ivory chess piece that once belonged to a mysterious king. An ancestor of yours found it and it has been passed down for many generations.                                                                                                                   |

| 7   | Skull of a creature that nobody can recognize. It resembles a large bird with a horn protruding from its forehead.                                                                                                                                              |
| 8   | A large and curious-looking bulb (botanical). Nobody knows what will grow if it's planted.                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 10  | A set of four bone dice, so worn that you can barely make out the symbols.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Determine a Name and Appearance
Now comes the hardest task of any would-be adventurer... choosing a name for oneself! Choosing the right name can be difficult sometimes but there is no shame in choosing a simple name. Your character could be the John of all Johns! Take a moment or two to consider some possible names before choosing one that strikes your fancy the most.

From there, think about their appearance! There is an appearance section of the sheet where you can jot down key details such as hair or eye color. Or you can use the space to doodle what your character might look like instead.

    With Ingram Wolfsbane, we sort of cheated and gave them a name from the start. But lets describe their appearance. Ingram is a stocky character with braided raven-black hair. Their eyes are like coals but their nose is rosy red. There is a scar on their left brow as well.

And just like that, you've got a character ready for play. If your character has a supernatural practice, it would be worth your time to review the Supernatural section next for more details on what it has to offer.
