# The Marketplace

Heroes are often defined by their actions and deeds but adventuring is more than just fighting monsters. A well seasoned adventurer will also know their way around a marketplace. The marketplace of any settlement is the backbone of anyone willing to travel the dangerous roads ahead.

A character's ability to interact with the marketplace is primarily defined by their Wealth rating, an abstract measurement of their financial resources. A given Wealth rating determines the maximum **market value** of an item they can obtain when interacting with the marketplace.

## Items
All items within Mythmakers have a size rating and a quality rating.

### Size
An item’s size rating represents both how large an item is and also how much space it takes up when placed within a pack or container. Items with a size rating of zero such as jewelry, trinkets, or written letters have no impactful size or weight up to a reasonable degree.

| SIZE     | SIZE RATING |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Mini     | 0           |
| Tiny     | 1           |
| Little   | 2           |
| Small    | 3           |
| Average  | 4           |
| Giant    | 5           |
| Huge     | 6           |
| Colossal | 7           |
| Mythical | 8           |

### Quality
An item’s quality rating represents both an item’s quality and its durability. The quality rating of an item generally ranges between 1 and 6, with each value being tied to a descriptor as shown in the table below. As the game progresses, items can degrade or increase in quality. When an item’s quality rating reaches zero through whatever means, it is broken and cannot be used until repaired.

| Quality    | Quality |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Broken     | 0       |
| Decrepit   | 1       |
| Worn       | 2       |
| Average    | 3       |
| Fine       | 4       |
| Excellent  | 5       |
| Masterwork | 6       |

### Collections
Within Mythmakers, some items such as rations and candles are grouped together into a single item. They still bear size and quality ratings but are affected by usage. This aspect is detailed further in any item section with a usage passage.

## Market Value
The market value serves as an approximation for how costly an item is to purchase using resources or a character’s Wealth aspect. An item’s market value is determined by taking the accumulated sum of its rarity rating and its quality rating. The lowest an item’s market value can possibly be is zero. If any modifiers cause the market value of an item to fall below zero, then its market value is set to zero.

The market value acts as the base price for an item. All interactions with the Marketplace will focus on shifting the market value of an item higher or lower than the base value.


$$ \text{Market Value} = Rarity + Quality $$

### Rarity
The rarity of an item is a sum of both the scarcity of the item and the rarity of certain details or embellishments associated with a given item.

| Rarity    | Market Value Modifier |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Common    | 0                     |
| Uncommon  | +1                    |
| Rare      | +2                    |
| Very Rare | +3                    |
| Epic      | +4                    |
| Legendary | +5                    |
| Mythical  | +6                    |

### Size Step
The Size Step of an item represents the difference in size between the general populace of the settlement housing the marketplace and the buyer themselves. Most interactions with the marketplace will be between average sized folks but there may be circumstances when the party interacts with smaller or larger marketplaces. In these cases, take the size rating of the buyer and compare it to the number of steps it takes to reach the general size rating of the marketplace.

| SIZE     |
| -------- |
| Mini     |
| Tiny     |
| Little   |
| Small    |
| Average  |
| Giant    |
| Huge     |
| Colossal |
| Mythical |

>Consider a case where an average sized character is buying items from a goblin marketplace. The size rating of an average goblin is small and therefore is one step away from the average sized buyer. This increases the rarity of average sized items when interacting with that specific marketplace.

## Buying from the Marketplace
To buy an item from the marketplace, a character first determines the market value of the item being set by the vendor. If the market value of an item is less than a character's Wealth rating, then the character can simply acquire the item if the vendor is willing to sell it to them.

However, if the market value of the item is equal to a character's Wealth rating, then they can spend a mark to acquire the item. If a character has no marks to spend, then they decrement their Wealth aspect by 1 but receive five marks.

If an item's market value is greater than the character's Wealth, then they are unable to afford it and cannot purchase it.

## Selling to the Marketplace
To sell an item to the marketplace, a character first begins by determining the market value of the item itself. If the market value of the item is less than their Wealth rating, then they can simply sell the item and remove it from their pack.

However, if the market value of the item is equal or greater to their Wealth rating, then they can make a Market Test. In a Market Test, a character rolls a number of dice equal to the item's market value. Each success grants them a mark to their Wealth rating. When a character gains six marks towards Wealth, all marks are reset and a character's Wealth aspect increases by 1.


## Haggling
When buying and selling goods and services from the marketplace, the market value can be influenced through haggling. Whether buying or selling, the interaction begins when the character starts a Resolve Contest with a vendor. After all, one side is trying to push the market value of an item and the other side is trying to resist.

For haggling used towards *buying* an item, if the character earns more successes than the vendor, then the market value of the item is decreased by 1. If the character manages to earn at least double the successes of the vendor, then the market value of the item is decreased by 2 but no further.

Upon *selling* an item, if the character earns more successes than the vendor, then the market value of the item intended to be sold increases by 1. If the character manages to earn at least double the successes of the vendor, then the market value of the item increases by 2 but no further. If a vendor cannot afford the new market value of the item, then they may offer another item or a favor in addition to the deal.

Note that some vendors may not be as willing to haggle as others. Depending on the vendor, a nature of theirs may need to be exploited or additional resources may need to be put on the table before they are willing to debate a price.

## Appraising
When a player arrives at a vendor in the marketplace, they will be given a market value for any items they wish to purchase. However, by making an Insight Test, they can determine if a vendor's presented market value is the true market value. If a character possesses a relevant rating in a profession or lore, the Insight Test is enhanced equal to the relevant rating. If more than one kind of Knowledge is touched upon then both ratings can be added towards the enhancement per the Storyteller's jurisdiction.

The result of the Insight Test is measured against the market value of the item itself. A result that is greater or equal to the actual market value of the item allows a character to determine whether a vendor is trying to upsell the item.

## Goods & Services
The purpose of this section is to layout how the market values of certain groups of items are determined as well as provide reference tables for interested buyers. The usage passage in each section describes how that items quality is influenced during play.

### Weapons
Weapons in the game have three additional properties compared to the average item: a Material and a Class. The material of a weapon is whatever material would be striking an opponent upon contact. A weapon’s Class determines both the size and how it's wielded. There are three Weapon Classes: Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, and Shields.

#### **Standard Materials**
| Material | Rarity        | Bonus                            |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Bronze   | Common (0)    | -                                |
| Iron     | Common (0)    | -                                |
| Wood     | Common (0)    | -                                |
| Bone     | Uncommon (+1) | -                                |
| Steel    | Rare (+2)     | +1 Enhancement to Weapon Actions |
___
#### **Melee Weapons**
Melee Weapons grant access to the Slash, Pierce, Bludgeon, and Throw Weapon Actions. The Aspect column determines the character Aspect used in order to perform the Weapon Action. Any item can serve as a Melee Weapon as long as it satisfies the criteria for the Weapon Action.



| Criteria          | Weapon Action | Invoked Aspect |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Is there an edge? | Slash         | Strength       |
| Is there a point? | Pierce        | Finesse        |
| Default           | Bludgeon      | Strength       |
| Default           | Throw         | Finesse        |

The type of a weapon determines how it is handled by its wielder. Light weapons are small weapons that can only be used in one hand. Versatiles weapons are weapons large enough to be wielded in one or two hands but require different Strength ratings in each case. Heavy weapons can only be wielded by using both hands. If a character's Strength rating meets the Strength requirement of a weapon, then they can use the weapon's Size rating as Enhancement towards a Contested action.

| Type      | Size Rating | Rarity        |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Light     | 1           | Common (0)    |
| Versatile | 2/1         | Uncommon (+1) |
| Heavy     | 3           | Rare (+2)     |

For characters of varying sizes, you can use the following calculations to determine what size an object needs to be in order to use them as a given type of weapon.

| Type      | Calculation     |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Light     | Size Rating - 3 |
| Versatile | Size Rating - 2 |
| Heavy     | Size Rating - 1 |

>A character with Strength 3 is able wield any Heavy Weapon with no issue. Whenever they make an Attack, the character can roll 3 dice from their Strength and 3 additional dice from the weapon’s Size rating.
>
>A character with Strength 2 using a Heavy Weapon would not be able to use the weapon’s Size rating as Enhancement and can only roll the 2 dice afforded to them by their Strength rating.

#### **Ranged Weapons**
Ranged weapons are used to send a piece of ammunition at a target from a distance. The use of any ranged weapon requires the use of two hands.

| Criteria                                                                      | Weapon Action | Invoked Aspect |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Is ammunition available and is a target within the base range of the weapon?  | Loose         | Finesse        |
| Is ammunition available and is a target outside the base range of the weapon? | Aim           | Finesse        |
| Is ammunition available?                                                      | Hold          | Strength       |
| Default                                                                       | Bludgeon      | Strength       |
| Default                                                                       | Throw         | Finesse        |

The **Loose** action requires using ammunition to make a ranged Weapon action against a target within the base range of the weapon. For this, a character makes a Finesse Test to create physical pressure matching the damage type associated with the ammunition. If the character’s Strength rating is equal to or greater than the size rating of the ranged weapon, they may add the weapon’s size rating as Enhancement to this Test.

The **Aim** action allows a character to use a Contested Action to make a Finesse Test in order to increase the default base range of the ranged weapon. If a character can earn enough successes to match the size rating of the ranged weapon, then they can increase the base range by one increment. This range reverts back whenever a Loose action is made to fire the piece of ammunition.

>A character with Finesse 3 is trying to shoot at a target beyond the 60ft base range their Shortbow allows. They make an Aim action and start a Finesse Test against the size rating of the shortbow which is 2. After receiving 2 successes, they are able to increase the base range from 60ft to 120ft until their next Loose action.

The **Hold** action is a free action that allows a character to turn the Loose action into a Concentrated action and allow for rolled successes to be saved until triggered the next round. The Hold action is useful in situations where a character wants to prepare a shot for a target that will be moving within the base range of the weapon. In order to use the Hold action, a character must succeed on a Strength Check. If the character fails, then the ammunition is spent and the successes are lost. Crossbows do not require a Strength Check in order to perform the Hold action.

##### **Common Ranged Weapons**
| Material | Weapon         | Base Range   | Size Rating | Rarity | S   | P   | B   |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| Leather  | Slingstaff     | 30ft/1 Zone  | 1           | 0      |     |     | X   |
| Wood     | Shortbow       | 60ft/2 Zones | 2           | 1      |     |     | X   |
| Wood     | Crossbow       | 90ft/3 Zones | 3           | 2      |     |     | X   |
| Wood     | Longbow        | 90ft/3 Zones | 3           | 2      |     |     | X   |
| Wood     | Heavy Crossbow | 90ft/3 Zones | 3           | 3      |     |     | X   |
| Wood     | Hand Crossbow  | 90ft/3 Zones | 2           | 3      |     |     | X   |

#### **Shields**
Shields are a hybrid between weapons and armor as they can be used for both offense and defense. To construct a shield, first choose a shield material and then determine its size rating. A shield’s size rating can serve as Enhancement whenever a character makes a Contested action to create physical resistance or as Enhancement to a Contest. Shields can also function as a melee weapon and get access to all of the Weapon Actions that entail so long as the shield fits the criteria for each Weapon Action.

### Armor Sets
Armor is the basis of protection within the world of Mythmakers. Common materials for armor generally include all types of Material. In the game, armor is represented by a character’s Armor Set.

To build an Armor Set, start by choosing one Material and then pair it with an Armor Type that matches its Material Class.

#### Armor Details
Armor Details are parts of an Armor Set that a player can determine for themselves. These could take the form of a special Helm of some sentimental value or a particular engraving that makes their breastplate stand out from the rest. They have no effect on the Armor Set itself.

### Apparel
Apparel consists of what a character wears beneath their armor. Clothing, jewelry, or items of particular make fall readily into this category. Here the player is at liberty to come up with what their character typically wears. As with all items, Apparel is sized for the species it was designed for and has a quality rating. The quality of one’s apparel can be useful to influence the opinions of nobility or to blend in with a common crowd.

The limits of Apparel are mostly consigned to the boundaries of common sense. For example, a character with two hands can really only wear two gloves unless magical mutations or supernatural trickery grants them a third.

### Packs
Packs are containers that allow characters to carry more on their person than their arms, armor, and apparel. Backpacks, satchels, bags, coin purses, and even carts represent packs that facilitate the containment of items every adventurer needs to continue their journeys. Packs, apart from having a quality and a size of their own, also possess a capacity rating. This value represents the maximum cumulative size it can carry.

| Pack     | Capacity | Size Rating |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Satchel  | 4        | 1           |
| Backpack | 8        | 2           |
| Cart     | 24       | 5           |
| Wagon    | 48       | 6           |

A pack cannot contain an item that is larger than its own size and characters cannot wear packs that are of equal or larger size than they are. However, you can certainly have packs inside other packs. In these instances, the pack’s Size rating is used rather than its capacity.

#### Encumbrance
A character can wear as many packs as is within reasonable boundaries of the imagination. If the Total Size of the items a character is carrying exceeds their Carrying Capacity, then the character’s Movement is hindered by the difference. In addition, any Encumbrance a character has also acts as Hindrance to all Tests based on Physical Aspects.

### Lights
The world of Mythmakers, while fantastical, is full of monsters and creatures that prowl in the night. For many creatures, darkness hinders wits and so light is needed. In order for a light source to be used, it must either be placed upon a surface or held in at least one hand.

Items that provide lighting cast out a radiance which represents the number of squares of unhindered vision for creatures with normal vision. Each turn that a light source is lit or casts illumination, its quality decreases by 1. When a light source’s quality reaches zero, then it is used up and it no longer casts light.

| Item           | Radiance | Size Rating | Rarity        |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Lantern Oil    | 5        | 1           | Rare (+2)     |
| Torches        | 3        | 1           | Common (0)    |
| Wax Candles    | 2        | 1           | Uncommon (+1) |
| Tallow Candles | 1        | 1           | Common (0)    |
| Matchsticks    | 1        | 0           | Common (0)    |

### Rations
This section describes rations which are used to stave off fatigue and restore vigor when they are used in the Exploration and Travel stages of gameplay.

Traveling on the road can result in times where one does not have the luxury of a tavern or a home cooked meal to warm them against the nightly cold. For this purpose, many adventurers and journeymen carry around rations. In Mythmakers, rations represent a combination of a character’s food and water supply.

Eating rations reduces a character’s Fatigue by 1 and increases their vigor equal to the quality of the rations. Upon using rations, the amount of rations decreases by 1. However, if a character goes a day without eating Rations, then their Fatigue increases by 1 the next day.

Rations can be used as many times as the characters feel necessary but they can only be used during the Exploration or Travel stages during Rests, not during Engagements. When a ration’s Quality rating has been reduced to zero, it is used up.

### Mounts
This section describes Mounts and the equipment associated with them. When purchasing a Mount, the Rarity and the Endurance rating of the Mount drives the Market Value. A Mount’s Size rating + Endurance rating determines the amount of Move Actions it is capable of in a given Turn. Packs, as listed in the Packs section of the Marketplace, can also be affixed to Mounts for ease of access.

| Item   | Size Rating | Rarity | Description                                                                            |

### Taverns
Staying at a tavern can provide benefits in the forms of a place to rest and a level of quality care. The Market Value of a tavern indicates the level of Wealth a character must possess in order to stay one night at the establishment. In exchange for staying at the tavern, the character can use the Quality rating of the tavern as Enhancement on their Endurance Tests during a Rest.

### Enchantments
In addition to an item’s size and quality ratings, it is possible for items to be equipped with Enchantments as well. Enchantments imbue an object with supernatural abilities or properties and function independently of the object itself. Additionally, if the object’s own Quality rating reaches 0 and becomes broken, then the Enchantment will also cease to function until the object is restored.

All enchantments have six properties: Quality, Supernatural Effect, Focus Power, Focus Area, Focus Range, and Focus Duration.

The Quality rating represents the durability of the enchantment in the face of nullifying magics as well as the number of times an Enchantment can be invoked. When an Enchantment has been invoked as many times as its Quality rating, it ceases to function until restored.

The Supernatural Effect describes what the Enchantment is designed to do. This will declare the supernatural practice being used and the specific supernatural keyword being utilized. In this fashion, enchanted items can share enchantments but may do completely different things. Look to the Supernatural Aspects section for additional details.

The Power represents the potency of the Supernatural Effect as per the Focus Action. What this Focus Power represents will depend on the Supernatural Effect’s description.

The Focus Area represents how many squares the Supernatural Effect covers as per the Focus Action.

The Range represents the range of squares the Focus Area can be moved from the object’s location as per the Focus Action.

The Duration represents the amount of Turns the Supernatural Effect persists for before expiring. This will include whether this timeframe encompasses Engagement, Local, or World Turns.

Enchantments will increase an item’s Rarity by the sum of its Quality rating and total Focus. To calculate the total Focus, add up the Focus Power, Area, Range, and Duration together.


#### Recharging Enchantments
Enchantments can be restored by one charge by either spending enough vigor equal to the amount of Focus in the Enchantment or waiting a number of World Turns equal to the total Focus of the Enchantment
