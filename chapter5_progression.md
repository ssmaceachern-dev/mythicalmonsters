## Earning Marks

As characters engage in the world of Mythmakers, they will undoubtedly experience moments of growth both physically and mentally. In the game, this growth is measured in terms of **_marks_**.

Characters gain a mark when they invoke an aspect and then earn a Minor Success or a Major Success after spending vigor equal to their current rating in the aspect. 


---

>A character with a Strength of 2 must spend 2 vigor and obtain a Minor or Major Success in order to earn one mark towards their Strength aspect.


---

When a character has earned six marks towards an aspect, then the aspect's rating increases by 1 and all marks are reset.

## Improving Knowledge
Improving knowledge can occur when a character's Common, Esoteric, or Linguistic knowledge is used as Enhancement towards a Test. If the dice rolled result in a Minor or Major Success and the number of dice rolled equal the applied Knowledge's rating, then the applied knowledge rating gains a mark. When a given Knowledge gains six marks, its rating increases by 1 and all marks are reset.

However, a character's rating in a given Knowledge cannot exceed the rating of their Memory aspect. A character cannot receive marks unless their Memory rating is greater than the rating of the applied knowledge.

## Improving Professions
Within Mythmaker, Professions function as both Aspects and Knowledge. When a character makes a Profession Test to perform a Test, they can use vigor towards the Test and receive marks as with a normal Aspect. However, if the Profession is used as Enhancement towards a Memory Test, then it can also receive a mark. If the dice rolled result in a Minor or Major Success and the number of dice rolled equal the applied Profession's rating, then the character receives a mark towards that Profession.

## Improving Martial Practices
As a character engages in combat, the experience they receive can lead to the betterment of a Martial Practice if they possess a rating in one. If the dice rolled result in a Minor or Major Success and the number of dice rolled equal the applied Martial Practice's rating, then the applied Martial Practice gains a mark. When a given Martial Practice gains six marks, its rating increases by 1 and all marks are reset.

However, a character's rating in a given Martial Practice cannot exceed the rating of their Finesse aspect. A character cannot receive marks unless their Finesse rating is greater than the rating of the applied knowledge.

## Improving Supernatural Practices

A character with a rating in a Supernatural Practice gains the opportunity to obtain marks through the continued use of this practice.

Creating a supernatural effect requires defining its four attributes: Power, Area, Range, and Duration. When a character spends vigor towards the Power aspect of an effect and obtains a Minor or Major success, they earn a mark towards that Supernatural Practice.


## Obtaining Mastery

When an aspect, knowledge, profession, or practice rating reaches the maximum value of 6, any further marks go towards achieving a Mastery in that rating. A rank of Mastery allows a character to gain Ease towards Tests that use the rating equal to the rank of Mastery. 

When a character gains a rank in this fashion, the marks for that rating reset like normal but the rating remains at 6. Instead, a diamond adjacent to the aspect is filled to represent the character's ascent into mastering an ability.

The highest mastery a given aspect can achieve is six diamonds.

>A character with Strength 6 obtains the sixth mark they needed to increase the rating. They remove all marks and fill in a diamond. Now whenever they make a Test using Strength, they gain 1 Ease automatically.
