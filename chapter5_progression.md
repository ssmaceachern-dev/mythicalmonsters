## Earning Marks

As characters engage in the world of Mythical Monsters, they will undoubtedly experience moments of growth both physically and mentally. In the game, this growth is measured in terms of **_marks_**.

Characters gain a mark when they earn a Minor Success or a Major Success while spending vigor to use a Physical, Mental, or Supernatural aspect towards a challenge.

Characters gain a mark when they apply either a Physical, Mental, or Supernatural aspect and spend vigor equal to their current rating in the aspect and earn a Minor Success or a Major Success.

>A character with a Strength of 2 needs to spend 2 vigor and either obtain a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder in order to earn one mark.
>
>Alternatively, a character with the Magical Practice of Create Fire at a rating of 2 must spend 2 vigor towards Focus Power (on top of Ease that they earn from their practice) and obtain a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder in order to earn one mark

When a character has earned **six marks **in a given Aspect, then the Aspect increases by 1 and the amount of marks obtained reset to zero.


## Improving Professions, Knowledge, or Practices

Aspects are not the only things that can be improved with marks. A character can also gain marks towards improving Professional skill, Knowledge, or a Practice.

In order to earn a mark towards these characteristics, they must be incorporated into a Contested Action where vigor was spent. If the spent vigor results in a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder then the character gains a mark towards those applied characteristics. This also means it is possible for a character to gain marks towards both aspects and characteristics at the same time.

>A character with an Insight of 3 and Knowledge (Folklore) 2 must spend at least 2 vigor towards applying Insight related to Myths and obtain a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder.
>
>If only 2 vigor is spent and obtains a special result, then only the Knowledge (Folklore) can receive a mark. If three are rolled, then both Knowledge (Folklore) and the applied aspect receive a mark.

## Learning New Skills

Characters can also _learn _new professions, new Knowledge, and new Practices that they did not possess before. In order to learn a new skill, a character must be in an environment where they can learn the new skill or knowledge.

The character must then make an Insight Check. When a character has succeeded on six _consecutive_ Insight Checks in this fashion, they can increase their new Skill rating from 0 to 1. However, if any of the Insight Checks fail during this process, then they must start over.

Characters with the skills that another is trying to train in can assist in this by applying their relevant Profession, Knowledge, or Practice towards the otherâ€™s roll.


## Obtaining Mastery

When an Aspect, Profession, Knowledge, or Practice manages to get enough Marks to surpass a rating of 6, it gains a rank of Mastery. A rank of Mastery allows a character to gain Ease towards that respective characteristic equal to the rank of Mastery. When a character gains a rank in this fashion, the marks for that characteristic reset and then the character must earn a number of marks equal to their rating plus the ranks of Mastery they possess in it.

For example, if a character had 2 ranks of Mastery in their Strength Aspect, then every time they used the Strength Aspect, they would get 2 Ease (or 2 automatic successes) towards performing the Action.
