# Downtime

After the characters have returned from their adventure, the Storyteller may provide Downtime to the players to do with as they wish. In Downtime, the rules of the game relax and the focus becomes the individual activities of the characters outside the scope of the usual adventure. 

There are two kinds of Downtime Actions a character can perform: **Daily Actions** and **Weekly Actions**. As so named, Daily Actions take one day to complete and Weekly Actions take a week. This section describes a number Downtime Actions a character can take that can be either Daily or Weekly Actions.


## Training

During downtime, characters can choose to spend their time training their ability in an aspect, profession, knowledge, or practice they currently possess a rating in. Training cannot be used towards an ability a character does not have a rating in. Training can only target one ability at a given time.

### **Daily Action**
When a character spends a Daily Action towards Training, they gain the option to make a Training Test. To make a Training Test, the character rolls a number of dice equal to the rating of the aspect, profession, knowledge, or practice they are trying to train. If the result is a Minor or Major Success, then the character obtains a mark. Any other result causes the Training attempt to fail.

However, a character can opt to pass on the Training Test instead. When this option is taken, the character receives one Ease towards their next Training Test. If the character's next Training Test still fails even with Ease, then the Ease is lost and the character must start the attempt over.

A character will continue to accumulate Ease for each Daily Action spent towards Training without making a Training Test. Once a character has obtained enough Ease to equal the rating of the ability, all Ease obtained is reset and the character gains a mark in that trained ability.

### **Weekly Action**
A character obtains Ease towards a Training Test for every day of the week. Any Ease that isn't spent towards obtaining a Mark carries over into the next Training Test.

## Learning a New Skill

Characters can spend Downtime Actions towards learning skills, professions, knowledge, or practices they do not possess a rating in. In order to learn a new skill, the character must possess teaching material or have access to a mentor who can teach them.

### **Daily Action**
When a character spends a Daily Action towards Learning a new skill, they gain the ability to make an Insight Check. A Check requires only one success to pass. When a character has succeeded on this Check, they gain one Mark towards their new skill.

When a character has succeeded on six _consecutive_ Insight Checks in this fashion, they can increase their new skill's rating from 0 to 1. However, if they fail an Insight Check at any point, then all marks obtained thus far are reset.

### **Weekly Action**
A character that spends a Weekly Action towards learning a new skill can increase their rating in the new skill from 0 to 1 once the week has ended.

---


## Mentoring
Mentoring allows characters who possess a rating in a given ability to share their knowledge with willing pupils. In essence, this allows one character to teach one or more characters in their attempts at learning a new skill or training one they already possess.

In order for a character to be a mentor, they must possess a rating in a skill or aspect greater than whoever they are teaching.

### **Daily Action**
A character who spends a Daily Action mentoring another must make a Resolve Test. Each success obtained in the Resolve Test can be added towards another character's Training Test when improving an ability or Insight Check when learning a new skill.

If the mentor uses a number of dice equal to their Resolve rating and gains a Minor or Major success as a result of this test, then they gain a mark towards Resolve.

### **Weekly Action**
Characters who are being mentored gain Ease towards their Training Tests or Learning Tests equal to the Resolve of the mentoring character. If a character earns any amount of marks while being mentored, then the mentoring character gains one mark in Resolve.

\*If a mentored character gains enough marks to advance a rating such that the rating matches the mentoring character's rating, then the mentoring character also gains a mark in that skill.

## Working a Profession

Characters who possess a rating in a profession can choose to spend their Downtime working their trade in an attempt to earn extra Wealth. In order to obtain Wealth, a character requires a rating in a given profession as well as a workplace willing to hire them and pay them for their time.

### **Daily Action**
A character begins work by making a Profession Test. Each success obtained during this Test increases the Market Value of their service by 1. Once this action is completed, a character takes the total Market Value accumulated and makes a Market Test as if they were selling to the marketplace. See the Marketplace section for details on selling to the Marketplace.

### **Weekly Action**
A character that spends a Weekly Action towards Working a Profession gains Ease towards the Market Test equal to their Profession's rating. The character than makes a Profession Test. Each success obtained during this Test increases the Market Value of their service by 1. Once this action is completed, a character takes the total Market Value accumulated and makes a Market Test as if they were selling to the marketplace. See the Marketplace section for details on selling to the Marketplace.

## Redefine Ideals
A character's Ideals will often be put to the test during their adventures. Sometimes these Ideals can get in the way or a character experiences something that changes their perspective and forces them to redefine their views on the world.

### **Weekly Action**
When a character spends a Weekly Action to redefine their ideals, they gain the ability to change the wording of an existing Ideal or add a new Ideal to their character sheet.
___


## Recovering from Trauma
Characters will accrue Troubles over the course of an adventure and sometimes the mental or physical burdens can become too great. When this occurs, a character may need to spend some time recovering from their Troubles and Scars.

### **Daily Action**
When a character spends a Daily Action towards Recovering from Trauma, they gain the option to make a Recovery Test. For a Recovery Test, a character takes the number of Troubles & Scars they have and uses that as the Challenge Rating of the Test. If the character is trying to heal a Trouble, then the character must invoke their Resolve. For Scars, Endurance is invoked instead. If a character earns enough successes to match the challenge rating of the Test, then the Trouble or Scar gains one mark. When a Trouble or Scar gains six marks, then it is fully healed and a character gains the option to remove it from their sheet. However, if a character fails the Test, then one mark is removed from the Trouble or Scar instead.

### **Weekly Action**
When a character spends a Weekly Action towards recovering from Trauma, they gain one mark towards the Trouble or Scar of their choosing.

___

## Investigating
Downtime may come either between adventures or even directly in the middle of one. Characters interested in gaining more information can spend their Downtime Actions investigating leads or obtaining information now made available to them.

The player describes the kind of information they wish to pursue and the Storyteller determines the challeneges associated with the inquiry and whether certain moves could be condensed into Daily Actions or must be stretched across an entire Weekly Action.

___

## Crafting

Crafting allows for the the characters to create their gear and items. There are three requirements for crafting any item within the game: **Materials**, a rating in a relevant **Profession**, and a **Toolkit**.

The **_Materials_** serve as the material components of the item. For most items, there is one core material with any others simply being auxiliary or to embellish the item with finer details.

To craft an item though, one needs knowledge and experience in a **_Profession_** that makes the item. For example, a blade can only be made by someone with experience as a Blacksmith or a Bladesmith.

And finally, a **_Toolkit_** is needed to craft the item itself. For blades, a blacksmithing toolkit or a forge is required. For making potions, an alchemy toolkit is needed. Toolkits themselves are items that can be made but may require materials of their own.

Once all three requirements have been met, a character adds the rarity of the Material they are working with alongside the rarity of the item they are trying to make. If the item they are trying to make falls beyond the scope of items set in the Marketplace section, then the Storyteller can step in and determine an approximate rarity. This sum acts as the Crafting Challenge Rating.

### **Daily Action**
A character begins work by making a Profession Test. Each success obtained during this Test contributes towards overcoming the Crafting Challenge Rating of the item. If the result of the Test matches or exceeds the challenge rating, then the item obtains a mark. Once an item has obtained six marks, its quality rating increases from 0 to 1. All excess successes contribute towards the next Profession Test.

### **Weekly Action**
Each week that a character spends crafting allows them to make a **Profession Test** to craft the item. However, the crafter gains Ease equal to their Profession's rating multiplied by the number of days in the week.
