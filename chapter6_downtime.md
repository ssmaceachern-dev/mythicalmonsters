# Downtime

After the characters have returned from their adventure, the Storyteller may provide Downtime to the players to do with as they wish. In Downtime, the rules of the game relax and the focus becomes the individual activities of the characters outside the scope of the usual adventure. This section covers some activities characters can perform during their own Downtime.


## Training

During downtime, characters can choose to spend their time honing their Aspects, Professions, Knowledge, or Practices. In order to gain the benefits of training, a character must spend at least one week fully concentrated on the task and must have the means and materials to improve the ability being trained. After one week of training, a character gains one Ease towards improving at the ability of their choice. Once this Ease has been gained, the character can either make a **Test **using a number of dice equal to their rating using this Ease or they can save the Ease for the following week.

If a character decides to take the Test, then they must earn a Minor Success, a Major Success, a Minor Blunder, or a Major Blunder. Ease is then applied to the roll and replaces any Blunders with successes as if the character had rolled a 5 instead. Ease used in this fashion is lost if the roll is anything other than a Major or Minor.

However, if a character decides not to make a Test and to instead hold onto their Ease from training, they can opt to spend the Ease instead towards acquiring a rank outright. Once a character has acquired enough Ease equal to the rating of the Aspect being trained, they can spend the Ease altogether and earn a Mark.

Once a character has earned a Mark, all Ease acquired from training is reset.

>A character spending a week of training Strength 2 gains one Ease at the end of that week. They can then decide to spend the Ease towards a Strength Test or hold onto the Ease for another week.
>
>If they choose to make a Test, they must roll 2 dice and earn a Minor Success, Major Success, Minor Blunder, or Major Blunder. The one Ease is then used to convert one Blunder into one Success for the sake of achieving this. If the character manages to earn one of the special rolls, then they gain a Mark towards Strength and all Ease is reset. Upon failing however, all Ease is reset and the character must spend another week training.
>
>If the character decides to wait another week and gain another point of Ease though, they can spend the 2 Ease saved towards automatically earning a Mark in Strength instead.

## Mentoring

Characters can also choose to assist characters training in Downtime by providing mentorship in the relevant Aspects, Professions, Knowledge, or Practices. In order for a character to mentor another, they must satisfy two conditions: They must possess a rating in the associated ability equal to or greater to the character receiving the mentorship and they must succeed on an Insight Check after a week of mentoring the characters in question.

If the mentoring character succeeds on the Insight Check, then the mentored character gains an additional point of Ease towards their training. However, if the mentoring character fails, then they provide a point of Hindrance to the mentored character. This Hindrance only lasts for the week and does not affect the mentored character’s accumulated Ease.

>Consider a case where a Mentor with Strength 3 Insight 1 is mentoring another character with  Strength 2. After one week has passed, the mentored character gains one Ease. The Mentor must then make an Insight Check and earn one success.
>
>If the Mentor succeeds on the Insight Check, then the mentored character gains an additional point of Ease and would be able to spend it on a Mark. However, if the Mentor fails, then the mentored character gains Hindrance for that week and wouldn’t be able to get the Mark until after another week of training.

## Working

Characters looking to improve their Wealth Aspect can choose to work their Profession during Downtime. Characters that spend a week working in a profession they have a rating in can make a **Profession Test. **Any successes earned from this test carry on to the next week and are cumulative. Once a character has earned more successes than their Wealth rating, their Wealth rating increases by 1 and all successes earned thus far are reset.


## Researching

Downtime is also the perfect time to research mysteries or intriguing discoveries made over the course of the previous adventure. Characters are at liberty to move around in the setting and apply their Aspects and Knowledge where they can serve to illuminate whatever ails their curiosity. Any traveling or expenses are handled as they would be during normal play.


## Crafting

Crafting allows for the players and their characters to create their own means of supply. There are three requirements for crafting any item within the game: **Materials**, a rating in a relevant **Profession**, and a **Toolkit**.

The **_Materials_** serve as the material components of the item. For most items, there is one core material with any others simply being auxiliary or to embellish the item with finer details.

To craft an item though, one needs knowledge and experience in a **_Profession_** that makes the item. For example, a blade can only be made by someone with experience as a Blacksmith or a Bladesmith.

And finally, a **_Toolkit_** is needed to craft the item itself. For blades, a blacksmithing toolkit or a forge is required. For making potions, an alchemy toolkit is needed. Toolkits themselves are items that can be made but may require materials of their own.

Once all three requirements have been met, a character can begin crafting their very own items. To begin, the character determines the Rarity of the Material and the Rarity of the item type and together these form the Crafting challenge rating.

Each week that a character spends crafting allows them to make a **Profession Test** with each success contributing towards overcoming the Crafting CR. Vigor cannot be used towards this Test. These successes are cumulative meaning all of the successes earned from Profession Tests each week are added together  towards the matching the Crafting CR. Once the Crafting CR is met, the item’s quality increases by 1 and any excess successes contribute towards increasing the quality again.

However, if any of the Profession Tests result in Minor Blunders, then the item’s quality decreases by 1. If the result is a Major Blunder, then the materials become unusable.

If a Minor Success, Major Success, Minor Blunder, or Major Blunder are achieved during the Profession Test, then the character gains a mark towards their applied Profession.
