# The Supernatural


## The Focus Action

The focus action is used to describe the four aspects of a supernatural effect: the strength of the effect, the area being affected, how far the area is, and the duration of the effect. For the supernaturally gifted to perform wondrous feats, _focus points_ are required. These focus points are spent towards defining a supernatural effect’s power, focus area, range, and duration. Characters with a rating in a supernatural practice gain focus points equal to their rating towards each aspect of a supernatural effect.

For example, A character with a rating of 2 in Create Fire can make a Focus Test at a rating of 2,  target an area anywhere within 60ft, target anything in a 2sq x 2sq area within that range, and make the effect last for up to two turns of an Engagement.

**Power** represents the potency of a supernatural effect and indicates how strong of an influence the caster wishes to exert over their targeted material form. The amount of focus points spent towards power represents an amount of dice to be rolled in the face of a present challenge.

The nature of this power and how it affects a situation is determined by the supernatural aspect being applied by the caster (Create, Alter, Sense, Manipulate, Destroy) and the material form being targeted (Magic, Fire, Water, Air, Materia, Body, Mind, Animal, Plant, Image).

**Focus Area** is the designated area where power is being exerted. Focus area is measured in terms of squares (sq) with each square representing enough space to encompass an average sized (size 4) creature. Each focus point spent towards an effect’s focus area increases the _largest dimension _(LD) the area can have by 1. For example, an area of 2 allows power to affect a 2 x 2 space or a 2 x 1 space as the largest dimension is 2 in both cases.

By default, a supernatural effect affecting the caster themselves or an adjacent square (but not both) has an area of 0. For creatures and forms to be affected, they must be at least partially contained within the effect’s area.

**Range** allows a caster to move an area of supernatural power away from themselves. Spending focus points towards range allows a caster to move an area of power up to an additional 6 squares per point allocated. If no focus points are spent towards range, then the focus area originates from the caster’s position.

**Duration** lets a caster determine how long the effect is intended to last for beyond the current turn. The focus point cost depends on how long the effect is intended to persist. For example, a caster who wants to create an effect lasting two Local turns would need to spend 12 focus points on duration. With the exception of Engagement turns, this cost includes the current turn.

| Turn       | Focus Point Cost                                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Engagement | 0 for the Current Turn. 1 Focus Point for each additional Engagement turn. |
| Local      | 3 Focus Points                                                             |
| World      | 12 Focus Points                                                            |

### Focus & Vigor
Just as with aspects, a creature can spend vigor to push Focus aspects beyond what they can achieve from their base practice rating. Each additional increase to a Focus aspect not only costs a point of vigor, but each increase also increases a character’s fatigue by 1 just as with aspects.

| Focus Aspect | Focus Point Cost                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Power        | -1 for each additional die. A creature can only roll an amount of dice up to the rating of their Supernatural Practice at a time. If vigor is used to increase power, then the dice rolled will be subject to Minor or Major Blunders.|
| Focus Area   | 0 if the effect is only self-targeted or is directed at an adjacent square. -1 per increment to the largest dimension of the area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Range        | 0 if the effect is self-targeted or manifests in an adjacent square. -1 to move the focus area an additional 6sq/30ft away from the caster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Duration     | 0 if the effect lasts only the current turn of an engagement. -1 for each engagement turn beyond the current one. -3 if the effect lasts for the entirety of the current Local turn and an additional -3 for each Local turn beyond the current turn. -12 if the effect lasts for the entirety of the current World turn and an additional -12 for each World turn beyond the current turn. |

### Supernatural Aspects

Supernatural aspects describe how supernatural power allocated in the focus action or in general influences a given situation. There are five supernatural aspects: Create, Alter, Sense, Manipulate, and Destroy. Each aspect comes with a set of keywords synonymous with the aspect itself.

To use a supernatural aspect, you begin by verbalizing your intent in the form of “I want to…” followed by the aspect or one of its keywords and the associated material form. For example, using the Create aspect to summon a simple fire might be phrased as “I want to _create fire_.” From this statement, the Storyteller determines the challenge created from the aspect or how the aspect affects a current challenge. Using Create Fire like before would create fire pressure in an engagement or might be used to increase the pressure of an existing fire.

This process is meant to inspire imagination in the caster and to properly ascertain their intent when using magic. Each section below describes the nature of each supernatural aspect and how they interact with material forms and their properties. Some aspects will overlap and this is by design; There are multiple ways of accomplishing something through supernatural means.


##### **Create**

**Keywords**: Manifest, Improve, Restore

The Create aspect is a constructive force which uses magic to manifest a form from the aether into the material world. Forms spawned this way do not possess inherent motion unless they are placed in the air where gravity can affect them.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Manifest</strong>
<p>
To manifest a form, the caster must determine whether or not the form being manifested is inanimate or animate.
<p>
Power allocated towards creating inanimate forms increases the power of a form's properties by one. For example, a property of fire is that it creates fire pressure.
<p>
To create an animate form, power must be allocated towards creating aspect advancements for the animated form’s physical and mental aspects (Strength, Finesse, Endurance, Insight, Wits, Resolve). Focus area is then used to determine the form’s size rating.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Improve</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards improving a form allows an existing form’s aspects to be enhanced for each point of power spent. For example, a character’s Strength aspect could be enhanced in this way.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Restore</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards restoring a form can either improve the quality of the form or heal wounds the form has sustained.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



##### **Transform**

**Keywords**: Alter, Scale, Enhance, Hinder

The Transform aspect is a transmutive force which uses magic to shift a form’s natural state from one stage to another. This aspect can only be used on forms within a supernatural effect’s focus area.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Alter</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards altering a form allows a character to increase or decrease a property’s rating. This can be used to increase the amount of pressure a form is exerting or hinder it. Altering a form’s image does not require power but altering any of the senses it gives off does.
<p>
This can also be used to add to a natural pressure contained within the form. Water could be altered to produce acid pressure, for instance.
<p>
If a caster possesses multiple supernatural practices using Alter, they can grant a form properties naturally possessed by another. For example, fire could be given the properties of water so that it can be contained as a liquid.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Scale</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards changing the size of a form must first equal the form’s current size rating. Once the target number is reached, every point of power spent beyond the form’s current size can be used to increase or decrease its size rating by one rank.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Enhance</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards enhancing a form allows that form to receive enhancement towards  a targeted aspect equal to the power provided.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Hinder</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards hindering a form allows that form to receive hindrance towards a targeted aspect equal to the power provided.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



##### **Sense**

**Keywords**: Sense

The Sense aspect is a divinating force which uses magic to detect a form and reveal details hidden from plain sight. The Sense aspect can only divine forms within a supernatural effect’s focus area.


```
Sense
Power allocated towards sensing a form begins an open test. One point of power will let the caster know whether a form exists in the focus area. Each additional point of power reveals one additional detail about the targeted forms per the Storyteller's jurisdiction.
```



##### **Manipulate**

**Keywords**: Move, Shape, Influence, Ward

The Manipulate aspect is an influential force which uses magic to force a shift in the natural capabilities based on the will and intent of the caster. The Manipulate aspect can only be used on forms within a supernatural effect’s focus area.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Move</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards moving a form allows a form to be moved enough squares equal to the power exerted. The targeted forms must be within a focus area and within range of the caster.
<p>
Moving a form up into the air causes it to immediately fall. During an engagement, this is handled during the World’s Turn. Movement does not need to be purely lateral either. A puddle of water can be made to cover a focus area centered around a puddle or the caster themselves.
<p>
Moving a form like a projectile functions as if it were being used as part of the Throw weapon action. Upon impact, the focus power allocated converts into a relevant physical pressure type enhanced by the form’s size rating. For example, throwing a stone spear with size 2 with power 4 will create a throw that yields 6 piercing physical pressure if it manages to reach a creature’s square.
<p>
Forms can also be made to move other forms like in the case of platforms or even flying carpets. The total size and weight compounded upon the form does not impact this effect so long as the caster maintains concentration.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Shape</strong>
<p>
Shaping a form allows an area of inanimate material to be reshaped to the caster’s will. Power is not required for this but the focus area must contain the breadth of the manipulation. For example, shaping a bridge out of a cliff wall must have a focus area that reaches the other side. Shaping a form in this way does not change its natural state and persists beyond the effect’s duration.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Influence</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards influencing a material form affects both inanimate and animate forms in different ways.
<p>
Influence on inanimate forms allows a caster to spend power towards using the form to make an action or to enhance actions a form might make. If the form is in a different square from a caster’s target, the focus area must encapsulate both in order for the action to apply.
<p>
Influence on animate forms begins a contest where power is used to exert pressure while the targeted forms create resistance. For example, if power is used to force a targeted creature’s body to make a strike on its comrade, then the creature would be able to resist using its physical aspects. If a creature is mentally influenced into making an action against its traits or ideals, then the creature gains one die of enhancement towards resisting the effect.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Transition</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards transitioning a material form allows a caster to shift it from one natural state to another. Power used in this way allows a form’s age to be shifted by one step. Shifting liquid water into solid ice or mist counts as one step for this purpose. Forms transitioned in this way do not gain any pressure and so turning water into ice would not create cold pressure but it would create restraining pressure on a target.
<p>
It can also be used to accelerate actions that a material form would take normally. Power spent in this fashion represents the amount of time the form is accelerated according to the Duration focus point cost table.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Ward</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards wards allows a caster to generate resistance towards any actions performed by the targeted form. It would also prevent targeted forms from moving into the focus area of the effect. For example, a ward against animals would provide additional resistance against any weapon actions made.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



##### **Destroy**

**Keywords**: Damage, Decay, Diminish, Hinder

The Destroy aspect is a deconstructive force which uses magic to deconstruct a form or a form’s inherent properties. The Destroy aspect can only be used on forms within a supernatural effect’s focus area.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Damage</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards damaging a material form allows a caster to inflict wounds towards an animate form. The damage inflicted is equal to the power exerted but can be resisted by an animate creature’s Endurance rating. Damage inflicted is permanent and persists beyond the effect’s duration unless restored or healed.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Decay</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards decaying a material form allows a caster to decrease an object’s quality rating by an amount equal to the power provided. If the object’s quality rating reaches zero, then it is destroyed.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Diminish</strong>
<p>
Rather than purely destroying a form, power can also be used to diminish a form’s natural properties. Rather than destroying a fire, its radiance could be diminished instead to prevent notice. Power used in this fashion hinders the relative quality of the property equal to the amount of power applied.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Hinder</strong>
<p>
Power allocated towards hindering a form allows a form’s targeted aspect to be hindered equal to the power exerted. This only affects aspects used to make actions, not inherent aspects like size.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Material Forms
A material form is an aspect of reality that can be changed or influenced by supernatural forces. Within the game of Mythmakers, there are ten distinct material forms that can be affected by supernatural power. 

Every material form has a natural state which is composed of the natural properties it possesses in the material world. For example, the natural state of water can range from mist to liquid to ice. Water can also boil or freeze and going from one stage to the other is a natural step. Natural changes to a material form’s state will persist beyond the set duration. This includes any damage a form has sustained, any restoration provided, or expected shifts in state. The only way a supernatural effect can remain permanent is by crafting an enchantment. To learn more, go to the Enchanting section under Downtime for more details.

Each material form has a number of natural properties: pressures, resistances, and attributes. Pressures are the forces a material form can naturally exert while resistances are the forces a form naturally resists. Attributes are natural aspects of the form that can be manipulated or have a direct influence over gameplay. The attributes ‘sense’ and ‘image’ for example represent how the form is perceived by the senses.

### Combining Multiple Forms and Aspects

Supernatural Aspects and the Forms they affect can be combined into new effects as long as the creature or character’s wielding them have the aptitude to do so.

For example, in order to create a cloud of scalding Steam, a character must have a rating in Create Water _and _Create Fire. Similarly, in order to turn a Person into an Animal, a character must have ratings in both Alter Body and Alter Animal. 

The Supernatural Aspect must be the same in order for a character to take characteristics and Traits of one Form and apply them to another.

As a part of a character’s Turn, a character can also utilize multiple combinations of Supernatural Aspects sequentially. In one Focus Action, a character can use Compel Water to form a spear of ice from a nearby puddle and then use Move Water to hurl the ice spear at a target provided the character has enough Focus to spend.


### Using Magic

Wielding the powers of the supernatural in the game of Mythmakers takes the form of a conversation with the Storyteller. Throughout the game, the Storyteller will place situations, encounters, and obstacles before the players and the players choose how their characters interact.

When using supernatural power to respond to a situation, the player describes how they use the magic available to them to respond. If the player’s idea falls within the scope of the applied Aspect, then the Storyteller then determines the main factor or factors that could cause difficulty for the character. The player then spends Vigor to build Focus and rolls a number of dice equal to the Focus Power in order to manage the effect.

## Spirits

A spirit is a presence in the material world with no Physical Aspects. This means that on their own, a spirit cannot physically interact with the world unless they possess a physical creature or object.

Inanimate objects can be possessed without much difficulty. When a spirit possesses an inanimate object, they gain the ability to move about and control the object as an extension of themselves.

Animate or living creatures require the spirit to issue a **Resolve Contest** against its target. If the spirit is successful in overwhelming the target creature, it gains access to its Physical Aspects for the Turn.

The spirit can repeat this contest once per Turn until it is either convinced otherwise or is expelled from the material world.


## Curses

A curse is a supernatural effect that has a long or even permanent duration. Often curses and hexes are the result of powerful beings casting malevolent magics upon the material world. Curses come in a large variety but each one has five properties: its Origin, its Nature, its Strength, its Interval, and its Cure.

The **Origin** of a curse is the active entity maintaining the curse. If the origin of a curse is defeated or killed, then the curse is lifted from other afflicted creatures. This can prove difficult though if the curse comes from the powers of greater beings and entities.

The **Nature** of a curse determines the Supernatural Effect caused by the curse. Here Supernatural Aspects define what the curse does and the linked Material Forms determine what is being affected.


The **Strength** of the curse determines the challenge rating imposed by the curse or the level of force generated by the curse when the next Interval occurs.

The **Interval** determines when the curse will happen. Lycanthropy, for example, can be taken as a form of curse where the Interval is every full moon. Intervals can occur once per day, once per month, or occur under any specific circumstances.

The **Cure **of a curse specifies a course of action that needs to occur in order for a cursed creature to either lift the curse or bypass the Interval. Some curses may not have a cure at all and may require a specialist to remove it.


### Removing Curses

Curses can be removed under certain circumstances. If the Origin of the curse can be found and destroyed or convinced to lift the curse, then the curse will end.

Otherwise, a specialist will be needed. A curse at its core is a supernatural effect meaning that Supernatural Aspects can be used against it to destroy or alter it in some fashion. The Supernatural Practice of 'Magic Destruction' is a good example of an ability that would be able to affect a curse.

Once this condition has been met, the creature or character in question needs to generate enough Focus Power to overcome the Strength of the curse. Once this occurs, the curse is broken from all creatures in the targeted Focus Area.
