# The Supernatural
In Mythmaker, there are individuals who have obtained, in one manner or another, the ability to conjure and command supernatural powers. In some circles of civilization, this ability is called "the gift" while others demonize the practice of arcane arts altogether. In Mythmaker, supernatural powers are classified by the caster's **intent** and the **form** being affected. A caster's intent describes how they are subjecting a given form to their will. Together these form a shorthand phrase summarizing the caster's ability.

>$\text{Create (Intent)} + \text{Fire (Form)} = \text{Create Fire}$

Characters who are Magical, Devotional, or Mystical all receive access to the Focus Action, an action that is used to manifest their will upon the world.

## The Focus Action

The focus action is what allows a character with a rating in a supernatural practice to make use of their abilities. Within Mythmaker, a supernatural ability allows a character to change the conditions of a Test or even bypass a Test entirely. 

Casters begin this action by converting a given number of vigor into *focus points*. These focus points are then spent towards a supernatural effects four characteristics: The **power** of the effect, the **area** effected by its power, the **range** from the caster, and the **duration**. Each characteristic will list how much focus points certain aspects will cost. 

Because the character is using vigor, they will subtract one point from their Recovery whenever they take this action.

>A caster converts 5 vigor into 5 focus points and then subtracts 1 from their Recovery.

### **Power**
Power represents the potency of a caster's intent upon their targeted form. In order to create an effect, you must describe what you would like to do in relation to the intent being invoked. There are five intents a caster can use towards any given form: Create, Transform, Identify, Manipulate, and Destroy. The Intents section describes how to use each intent and how they can affect play.

The Power rating of a supernatural effect is used to make a Power Test where each success of the Test is used to empower whatever Intent is being used on a given form.

#### **Focus Point Cost**
1 Focus Point increases the effect's Power rating by 1.

The amount of focus points spent towards an effect's power cannot exceed the caster's rating in the supernatural practice.

### **Area**
Area is used to indicate the targets of a given supernatural effect. Everyone within the bounds of an effect's area is subject to whatever power is being enforced upon them.

#### **Focus Point Cost**
1 Focus Point allows a caster to target one additional character.

Spending 6 Focus Points allows a caster to target an entire area.

The amount of focus points spent towards an effect's area cannot exceed the caster's rating in the supernatural practice.

### **Range**
Range allows a caster to move an area of supernatural power away from themselves.

#### **Focus Point Cost**
Targeting anyone within the same zone costs no focus points. Moving an area beyond the caster's current area costs 1 Focus Point per Area.

The amount of focus points spent towards an effect's range cannot exceed the caster's rating in the supernatural practice.

### **Duration**
Duration lets a caster determine how long the effect is intended to last for beyond the current turn. The focus point cost depends on how long the effect is intended to persist. For example, a caster who wants to create an effect lasting two Local turns would need to spend 12 focus points on duration. With the exception of Engagement turns, this cost includes the current turn.

| Action       | Focus Point Cost                                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Engagement | 0 for the Current Turn. 1 Focus Point for each additional Engagement turn. |
| Local      | 3 Focus Points                                                             |
| World      | 12 Focus Points                                                            |

The amount of focus points spent towards an effect's duration cannot exceed the caster's rating in the supernatural practice.

### Empower
A supernatural practitioner can also increase any one of these four aspects by an amount equal to their rating in the practice. However, this can only be applied to _one_ of the four aspects.

>A caster with Create Fire 3 can create an effect with up to 3 Power, target up to 3 targets, shift the range up to 3 areas away, and make the effect last for up to 3 Engagement turns. They can then increase any one of these aspects by an additional 3.


### **Intents**

Intents describe how the Power aspect of a supernatural effect is being applied to a situation or Test. There are five intents a caster can choose to specialize in: Create, Transform, Sense, Manipulate, and Destroy. Each aspect comes with a set of keywords which expand what a caster can do towards the form of their choice.

To use a supernatural intent, you begin by verbalizing your intent in the form of “I want to…” followed by the intent itself or one of its keywords as well as the . For example, using the Create aspect to summon a simple fire might be phrased as “I want to _create fire_.” From this statement, the Storyteller determines the challenge created from the aspect or how the aspect affects a current challenge. Using Create Fire like before would create fire pressure in an engagement or might be used to increase the pressure of an existing fire.


#### **Create**

**Keywords**: Manifest, Improve, Restore

The Create aspect is a constructive force which uses magic to manifest a form from the aether into the material world. Forms spawned this way do not possess inherent motion unless they are placed in the air where gravity can affect them.


##### **Manifest**
When using the Manifest Intent, you must determine whether you are creating an inanimate object or a creature. 

For objects, you must either find an object from the marketplace or describe one in well enough detail. The result of the Power Test determines the quality rating of the object while the Area determines the Size rating of the object.

For creatures, the results of the Power Test determines the creature's threat rating. A creature's threat rating is the value of all of its inherent aspects e.g. Strength, Finesse, Endurance, etc. The creature itself possesses none of the qualities that its real life counterpart would have as the caster is creating an imitation rather than a real creature.

##### **Improve**
The Improve Intent can be used when you are looking to enhance an aspect that does not have a maximum associated with it. This Intent can only be used on forms that already exist. The results of the Power Test act as enhancement towards the targets specified in the Area.

##### **Restore**
The Restore Intent can be used to restore aspects that have a maximum. The quality rating of an item or the vigor of a fellow ally are examples of aspects that can be restored.


#### **Transform**

**Keywords**: Resize, Redefine, Enhance, Hinder

The Transform Intent is a transmutive force which uses magic to shift a form’s natural state from one stage to another. An Intent to transform changes a form's properties or latent qualities.

##### **Resize**
The Resize Intent allows you to shift an object's or creature's size rating up or down a number of size steps. In order to resize an object, the results of the Power Test must surpass the size rating of the original target. For each success obtained that exceeds the target's size rating, the caster gains the ability to shift the size a corresponding number of size steps.

| SIZE     |
| -------- |
| Mini     |
| Tiny     |
| Little   |
| Small    |
| Average  |
| Giant    |
| Huge     |
| Colossal |
| Mythical |

##### **Redefine**
The Redefine Intent allows you to invoke the Storyteller in order to create a Test or change the conditions of a Test. 

For example, Redefine Materia could be used to turn a solid section of stone wall into malleable clay so the rest of the party can sculpt through it. The Storyteller must then determine a challenge rating suitable for the Test with the results of your Power Test acting counter to it.

##### **Enhance**
The Enhance Intent allows you to give enhancement an aspect of a form during a Test equal to the results of the Power Test.

##### **Hinder**
The Hinder Intent allows you to hinder an aspect of a form during a Test equal to the results of the Power Test. If a form is completely hindered in some form or fashion, it is not destroyed.


#### **Identify**

**Keywords**: Detect, Learn

The Identify Intent is a divinating force which allows a caster to make an Open Test to uncover information about a form in the area of the spell.

##### **Detect**
The Detect Intent allows you to extend your own senses to detect the existence of a form. The results of the Power Test determines the maximum number of a given form that a character can detect. Focus Points spent towards Area allow a character to use the Detect Intent within an entire Area as opposed to a single target.

##### **Learn**
The Learn Intent allows you to make an Open Test about a number of targeted forms. The results of the Power Test determine the level of information you can learn about a form. A low result may reveal common information while a high result may reveal lore about the form in question.

#### **Manipulate**

**Keywords**: Move, Shape, Command, Ward

The Manipulate Intent is an influential force which uses magic to force a shift upon a form. Unlike with the Transform Intent, the Manipulate Intent cannot change anything intrinsic about a form.

##### **Move**
The Move Intent allows you to levitate or move a single form around within a space. The results of a Power Test allow you to move a form a number of Areas equal to the number of successes. The Area of the effect must, however, equal the size rating of the form being moved in order for this Intent to manifest.

The results of the Power Test can also be used as enhancement, hindrance, or impairing pressure towards an Action that incorporates the targeted form.

##### **Throw**
The Throw Intent allows you to toss a form as if you were making the Throw weapon action. In order to throw an object at a creature using the Throw Intent, both the target and the targeted form must be within the caster's Range. The Area must also equal the size rating of the form being thrown.

The results of the Power Test is converted into Physical Pressure matching the type of object thrown. The Object's size rating also acts as enhancement towards this Action.

##### **Shape**
The Shape Intent allows you to manipulate the inanimate shape of a form. The Area of the effect must match the size rating of the object being manipulated. The results of the Power Test determine the quality of the shape. Animate creatures cannot be affected by the Shape Intent.

##### **Command**
The Command Intent allows you to manipulate a creature or object into making a specific action. If the target is an object, then the result of the Power Test acts as a corresponding type of physical pressure, resistance, or whatever the Storyteller deems appropriate.

If the target is a creature, then the result of the Power Test creates Impairing Pressure towards a creature. The creature receives ranks in the Troubled impairment and any action that goes against the command of the caster is hindered equal to the rank of the impairment.

##### **Ward**
The Ward Intent allows you to create resistance towards a Test or Action being made using supernatural power. The results of the Power Test either act as resistance to a pressure or act as hindrance towards a Test made using the targeted form. The Area aspect determines how many targets will also receive this same benefit.


#### **Destroy**

**Keywords**: Damage, Diminish, Hinder

The Destroy Intent is a deconstructive force which uses magic to deconstruct a form or a form’s inherent properties. The Destroy aspect can only be used on forms within a supernatural effect’s focus area.

##### **Damage**
The Damage Intent allows you to damage an object or a creature based around the form you are targeting. If the target is an object, then the results of the Power Test act as damage against the object's quality. If the object is reduced to a quality of zero, then it is considered broken. If the target is a creature, then the target receives physical pressure and cannot make an Armor Test to resist it.

##### **Decay**
The Decay Intent allows you to wither or erode a form before you. Any Tests to damage or hinder the target are enhanced equal to the results of the Power Test.

##### **Diminish**
The Diminish Intent allows you to destroy the presence of a form or mute a particular quality of a form. For example, the radiance of a torch could be diminished to avoid alerting creatures to one's presence. Or perhaps a person's own Senses could be diminished to create a form a invisibility. The results of the Power Test determine how much a form is diminished by in the context of being perceived by another creature.

### Material Forms
A material form is an aspect of reality that can be changed or influenced by supernatural forces. Within the game of Mythmakers, there are ten distinct material forms that can be affected by supernatural power. 

Each material form has a number of natural properties which can be made the target of a supernatural force. These properties are broken into three categories: Pressures, Resistances, and Characteristics. Pressures, as explained in other sections, allow a wielder of supernatural power to inflict damage or impair a target. Resistances in turn negate any pressures listed under its column. Characteristics are properties in the game that can be make the target of effects such as the sensory perceptions of a thing or even its quality.

### Combining Magic

Intents and the Forms they affect can be combined into new effects as long as the creature or character’s wielding them have the aptitude to do so.

For example, in order to create a cloud of scalding Steam, a character must have a rating in Create Water _and_ Create Fire. Similarly, in order to turn a Person into an Animal, a character must have ratings in both Alter Body and Alter Animal. The Power Test uses the lowest rating of whichever practice is being used.


### Using Magic

Wielding the powers of the supernatural in the game of Mythmakers takes the form of a conversation with the Storyteller. Throughout the game, the Storyteller will place situations, encounters, and obstacles before the players and the players choose how their characters interact.

When using supernatural power to respond to a situation, the player describes how they use the magic available to them to respond. If the player’s idea falls within the scope of the applied Aspect, then the Storyteller then determines the main factor or factors that could cause difficulty for the character. The player then spends Vigor to build Focus and rolls a number of dice equal to the Focus Power in order to manage the effect.

## Spirits

A spirit is a presence in the material world with no physical aspects. This means that on their own, a spirit cannot physically interact with the world unless they possess a physical creature or object.

Inanimate objects can be possessed without much difficulty. When a spirit possesses an inanimate object, they gain the ability to move about and control the object as an extension of themselves.

Possessing a living creature requires the spirit to issue a **Resolve Contest** against its target. If the spirit is successful in overwhelming the target creature, it takes control of the creature for a Local Turn.

The spirit can repeat this contest until it is either convinced otherwise or is expelled from the material world.


## Curses

A curse is a supernatural effect that has a long or even permanent duration. Often curses and hexes are the result of powerful beings casting malevolent magics upon the material world. Curses come in a large variety but each one has five properties: its Origin, its Nature, its Strength, its Interval, and its Cure.

The **Origin** of a curse is the active entity maintaining the curse. If the origin of a curse is defeated or killed, then the curse is lifted from other afflicted creatures. This can prove difficult though if the curse comes from the powers of greater beings and entities.

The **Nature** of a curse determines the Supernatural Effect caused by the curse. Here Intents define what the curse does and the linked Material Forms determine what is being affected.


The **Strength** of the curse determines the challenge rating imposed by the curse or the level of force generated by the curse when the next Interval occurs.

The **Interval** determines when the curse will happen. Lycanthropy, for example, can be taken as a form of curse where the Interval is every full moon. Intervals can occur once per day, once per month, or occur under any specific circumstances.

The **Cure **of a curse specifies a course of action that needs to occur in order for a cursed creature to either lift the curse or bypass the Interval. Some curses may not have a cure at all and may require a specialist to remove it.


### Removing Curses

Curses can be removed under certain circumstances. If the Origin of the curse can be found and destroyed or convinced to lift the curse, then the curse will end.

Otherwise, a specialist will be needed. A curse at its core is a supernatural effect meaning that Intents can be used against it to destroy or alter it in some fashion. The Supernatural Practice of 'Destroy Magic' is a good example of an ability that would be able to affect a curse.

Once this condition has been met, the creature or character in question needs to generate enough Focus Power to overcome the Strength of the curse. Once this occurs, the curse is broken from all creatures in the targeted Focus Area.
