# Impairments

## Physical Conditions

Physical conditions are status conditions that are inflicted by a physical source. A character can  recover from one physical condition by making an Endurance Test during Recovery.


### **Staggered**

## Natural Conditions

Natural conditions are conditions that can only be caused by natural pressure. For instance, the burning condition is gained when a character receives fire pressure.


### **Burning**



* A creature that is wearing an Armor Set with zero Fire Resistance gains the Burning condition with a rank equal to the Fire Pressure they receive.
* On the World’s Turn, a creature receives Wounds equal to the rank of this condition and then this condition’s rank increases by one.
* The Quality rating of a creature’s Armor Set and Apparel decreases by one for each Round this condition is held.


### **Freezing**



* A creature that is wearing an Armor Set with zero Cold Resistance gains the Freezing condition with a rank equal to the Cold Pressure they receive.
* On the World’s Turn, a creature loses vigor equal to the rank of this condition. If a creature’s vigor is reduced to zero, then the creature receives Wounds equal to the rank of this condition instead.

## Unconscious

An unconscious creature cannot perform Actions or provide any form of active resistance. If the creature is sleeping, then they must be roused awake by another creature or sufficiently loud noise. A creature that is unconscious and bloodied must make an Endurance Check or a Resolve Check during Recovery to be conscious in the following turn.


## Death’s Door

When a creature’s Wounds rating equals or exceeds their Death’s Door rating, they are on Death’s Door_.** **_Any further damage taken by the creature subtracts from their vigor rather than add to their Wounds.

If a creature is on Death’s Door by the time the World Turns, then the creature must make a Recovery Test and meet or exceed their Wounds rating. If they fail, then they gain one rank of the Unconscious condition. However, if the Recovery Test succeeds, then they either remove an existing rank from their Unconscious condition _or_ remain active in the following turn.


---

A character with Wounds rating 5 and a Death’s Door of 3 is on Death’s Door. When the World Turns, the character will lose 2 vigor and reduce their Wounds rating to match their Death’s Door rating. Additionally, they will need to roll a number of dice equal to their Recovery rating and earn enough successes to meet or beat their Wounds rating or take one rank of the Unconscious condition upon entering the following turn.


---


## Death

Three things must happen in order for a creature to die:



* The creature must be on Death’s Door.
* The creature must have zero vigor.
* The creature must have at least one rank of the Unconscious condition.

Once all three conditions have been fulfilled by the time the World Turns, then the creature effectively dies.


## Maladies

Maladies are physical phenomena like **poisons** and **diseases **that inflict ailments upon their victims. Maladies have five properties: Forms of Contact, Strength, Test Interval, Side Effects, and Cures.


### Forms of Contact

The Forms of Contact comprise how the malady is acquired. There are four common kinds of contact for maladies: Touch, Ingestion, Inhalation, and Wounds. It is possible for a malady to have multiple Application Methods.

**Touch**: Poisons that use this method need to be touched in order to activate.

**Ingested**: Ingested poisons need to be consumed in order to deal their effects to the victim.

**Inhalation**: Inhaled poisons take the form of gaseous clouds or powders that can be inhaled. Unless a creature is wearing a suitable face covering, they are subject to the effects of the poison as long as they are within the same square as the cloud.

**Wounds**: Poisons with this application method can only be effective when they are a part of an action that inflicts wounds on a creature.


### Strength

When a creature has been afflicted with a Malady, the affliction doesn't take effect until the end of the current Turn. If the **Test Interval** of a Malady happens at a more immediate stage of play, then the scene immediately shifts to that stage.

At the end of the Turn, the afflicted creature must make an Endurance** Test** against the indicated **Strength **of the Malady. Upon success, the creature is fine and the Strength of the Malady is reduced by 1. When the Strength of the Malady has been reduced to zero, the Malady is overcome.

On a failure, the afflicted character suffers the Side Effects of the Malady equal to the margin of failure and gains any symptoms associated with it.


---

For example, if a character ate food poisoned with one dose of Wolfsbane, then the scene would shift to the Engagement stage. At the end of the Turn, the poisoned character would need to make an Endurance Test.

In this example, the character has an Endurance rating of 2. They roll their 2 dice and gain 1 success against 3 which is the Strength CR of Wolfsbane. In this case, the margin of failure is 2 and the character takes 2 damage and gains 2 ranks of Suffocation as per the Side Effects of Wolfsbane.


---

This continues until the character has either overcome the Strength of the Malady through repeated Tests, the character receives a Cure to the current Malady, or until the character dies.

If a character takes multiple doses of a Malady, then the Strength of the Malady is increased per dose. If a character takes two doses of Nightshade, for example, the Strength of the Malady would become 2 instead of 1 for both doses.
