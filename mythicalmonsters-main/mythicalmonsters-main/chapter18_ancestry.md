# Making an Ancestry
Creating an ancestry or a species of sapient creatures is not all that different from creating a normal creature as shown in the previous section. The steps for making a culture are as follow:

1. Determine the Ancestry's Natural Aspects
2. Determine the Ancestry's Natural Size
3. Determine the Ancestry's Available Senses & Descriptors

## Determine the Ancestry's Natural Aspects
Every Ancestry as a pair of aspects they are naturally good at as a result of their natural development or due to the origins of their creation.

The core common aspects an Ancestry may possess are: Strength, Finesse, Endurance, Sense, Memory, Insight, and Resolve. Choose any two to represent the possible boons a character descending from this ancestry may receive when making their character.

## Determine the Ancestry's Natural Size
Next, determine the average size a member of this ancestry may possess. The most common sizes range from Little to Giant. Anything more and the ancestry may experience some difficulty through the course of play.

|Size|Size Rating|
|-|-|
|Mini| 0|
|Tiny| 1|
|Little| 2|
|Small| 3|
|Average| 4|
|Giant| 5|
|Huge| 6|
|Colossal| 7|
|Mythical| 8+|

## Determine the Ancestry's Available Senses & Descriptors
The final thing left to determine about a given ancestry is the natural senses and abilities it may possess. The following senses and descriptors can serve as a guideline for options to offer should a player choose to pick the ancestry for their character.

#### **Sight**
___
***Common Sight***
Creatures with Common Sight are fully hindered during nightfall or when in unlit areas.

***Far Sight***
Creatures with Far Sight gain +1 Ease to Sense Tests when using their vision to see things that are beyond a common scope of vision.

#### **Hearing**
___
***Common Hearing*** Creatures with Common Hearing possess ears or similarly capable features that let them hear sounds and speech.
