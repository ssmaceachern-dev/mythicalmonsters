# Dice Rules
In Mythical Monsters, the outcomes of certain actions are determined by rolls of the dice. The numbers **4**, **5**, **6** are counted as successes while the numbers **1**, **2**, **3** are considered blunders.

When dice are rolled, only the successes are initially counted. For example, a roll that produces the result [1, 2, 4, 5, 6] would equal 3 successes. Blunders in this sense are neutral and don’t negate successes except in certain circumstances.
## Pushes
6 is a special number in the game of Mythical Monsters. When a player rolls a 6 on a die, they gain a ***push***. When a character earns a push, not only does the player count the result as a success, but they can then roll the same die again. The player gains an additional push for each 6 they obtain. If anything other than a 6 is rolled during a push, then the push ends and the results are accounted for normally.
________________


The roll below measures out to 2 successes, but there is one 6 which means that the roller gains one push. They then take the one die and reroll it.

Since the roll didn’t result in a 6, the push ends and the roller adds the result to the previous roll causing the total to sum up to 3 successes.

# Challenges
A challenge is anything that blocks the forward progress of the story or a character from taking an action freely. Narratives are full of challenges that test the abilities of the characters with some only having a trivial impact on the story while others can decide the outcome of life or death. In Mythical Monsters, challenges are created by the Storyteller and presented to the party of characters.


In Mythical Monsters, a challenge’s difficulty is measured by its challenge rating, or CR for short. The challenge rating represents the amount of successes needed in order for the obstacle to be overcome. An obstacle rated at CR 4 requires 4 successes in order for it to be considered overcome.


All challenges generally fit within the following scale of difficulty:


| Challenge Rating (CR) | Level of Difficulty                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CR 0                  | There is no obstacle                                                     |
| CR 1                  | An easy obstacle. Anyone can do it.                                      |
| CR 2                  | An average obstacle. Most can overcome it                                |
| CR 3                  | A difficult obstacle. Overcoming it is hard, but not impossible.         |
| CR 4                  | An extremely difficult obstacle. Only the experienced can overcome this. |
| CR 5                  | A master level obstacle. Only a master can handle this.                  |
| CR 6                  | A heroic obstacle. Masters can only hope to overcome it.                 |
| CR 7+                 | A mythical obstacle. Stories are told about those who overcome them.     |
## Challenge Types
While a challenge rating can indicate the amount of successes needed to overcome a given obstacle, the challenge type also indicates how those successes relate to the nature of the challenge.


### Blocks
Blocks are obstacles that passively resist forward progress. A block indicates that if the players don’t gain enough successes to overcome the obstacle, then nothing happens.


#### **BLOCK EXAMPLES**
	A boulder blocking a door, foliage blocking a road, a fence surrounding a manor…
	

### Snares
Snares are obstacles that passively resist movement. A snare indicates that if the players don’t gain enough successes to overcome the obstacle, then they must spend vigor equal to the number of successes required for them to overcome the challenge before they can make any additional Move Actions.


#### **SNARE EXAMPLES**
	A briar patch blocking a path through the woods, walking over a pile of collapsed rubble, walking through thick mud…
	

### Contests
Contests are obstacles that are made between two active entities. With contests, one side is exerting pressure while another side provides resistance. If the contesting side earns more pressure than the contested side’s resistance, then the margin of pressure exerted is inflicted on the other party. If the contesting side’s pressure is equal or less than the contested side’s resistance, then a stalemate is reached and nothing happens.


#### **CONTEST EXAMPLES**
	Physical Pressure vs Physical Resistance in Engagements, Stealth vs. Wits, Buying/Selling in the Marketplace
	

### Perils
Perils are obstacles that passively resist forward progress but have a danger attached to them if the players fail to match the challenge’s rating. Perils are often accompanied with some kind of hazard, or a risky situation where failing the challenge places some kind of pressure on a character. When a character makes an Action to overcome a peril, they may be called upon by the Storyteller to make a Resolve Check or gain one rank of the Troubled condition.


#### **PERIL EXAMPLES**
	A gaping chasm (Falling), a trap (Wounds/Poison/Disease), swimming into deep waters (Suffocating)…
	

### Checks
A check is a challenge where only one success is needed to pass. As long as at least one success is rolled, then a character overcomes the check. However, if the character does not manage to achieve any successes, then the character receives a negative consequence.


#### **CHECK EXAMPLES**
	Resolve Checks against a character’s Troubles, Endurance Checks to remain conscious while on Death’s Door
	

### Open
Open challenges do not have a hard challenge rating assigned to them. Open challenges are used as gauges to see how successful a character is at an open-ended action with the Storyteller themselves determining how much information they receive as a result of the action.


#### **OPEN CHALLENGE EXAMPLES**
	Investigating a room, using Insight to make academic judgements, using Wits to perceive details about the environment
	
# Making a Test
Players interact with challenges set forth by the Storyteller by making Tests. 

##	Vigor
Sometimes the results of a Test are not enough to overcome the challenge rating. When this occurs, a character may be encouraged to spend vigor in an attempt to earn more successes. Vigor is the characterization of a character’s lifeblood and is determined by taking the sum of a character’s physical and mental aspects: Strength, Finesse, Endurance, Insight, Wits, and Resolve. To spend vigor, a character subtracts an amount from their vigor equal to or less than the rating of the aspect being utilized. For example, if a character with a Strength rating of 2 wanted to spend vigor towards a Test, then they would subtract 2 from their vigor to roll 2 additional dice towards the Test.


A character can spend as much vigor as they would like in a Turn; however, each usage of vigor cannot exceed the associated aspect’s rating. For example, if a character with a Strength rating of 2 were to spend 4 vigor, it would be rolled in increments of 2.


In addition, whenever a character spends vigor, their fatigue rating increases by 1. Fatigue is a measurement of your character’s exhaustion and its impact on gameplay is explained further in the Recovery section.
### Minors & Majors
When a player spends vigor, there is a chance of earning a Minor or a Major. Each Minor or Major alters a Test based on the result obtained.

* A Minor Success occurs when all dice rolled result in a success. A Minor Success indicates a favorable condition and provides 1 additional success to the roll. So if a Minor Success was achieved with 4 dice, then the result equals 5 successes total. 

* A Major Success occurs when all dice rolled land on a 6. The number of successes from the roll equals double the number of dice used. So if a Major Success is achieved with 4 dice, then the result equals 8 successes total.

* A Minor Blunder occurs when all dice rolled result in a blunder. A Minor Blunder indicates the occurrence of an inconvenience. When a Minor Blunder is rolled, the amount of successes achieved towards overcoming a Test is reduced by 1. If no successes can be reduced, then the challenge rating of the obstacle itself is increased by 1.

* A Major Blunder occurs when all dice rolled land on a 1. A Major Blunder indicates that a significant misfortune has occurred. When a Major Blunder is rolled, the amount of successes achieved towards overcoming a Test is reduced equal to the number of dice rolled. If no successes can be reduced, then the challenge rating of the obstacle itself is increased by the number of major blunders achieved.

When a character spends vigor equal to the aspect they are using towards a Test and earns a Minor or a Major, they also earn a mark in that aspect. Marks are how progression is recorded in Mythical Monsters. Once an aspect has earned six marks, the aspect’s rating increases by 1 and all marks are reset.
